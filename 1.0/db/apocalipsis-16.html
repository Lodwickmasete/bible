<p><h2>Revelation 16</h2><span id="en-AMP-30955" class="sup">1</span>THEN I heard a mighty voice from the temple sanctuary saying to the seven angels, Go and empty out on the earth the seven bowls of God's wrath and indignation.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30955A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30956" class="sup">2</span>So the first [angel] went and emptied his bowl on the earth, and foul and painful ulcers (sores) came on the people who were marked with the stamp of the beast and who did homage to his image.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30956B" title="See cross-reference B">B</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30957" class="sup">3</span>The second [angel] emptied his bowl into the sea, and it turned into blood like that of a corpse [thick, corrupt, ill-smelling, and disgusting], and every living thing that was in the sea perished.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30958" class="sup">4</span>Then the third [angel] emptied out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of water, and they turned into (became) blood.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30958C" title="See cross-reference C">C</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30959" class="sup">5</span>And I also heard the angel of the waters say, Righteous (just) are You in these Your decisions and judgments, You Who are and were, O Holy One!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30960" class="sup">6</span>Because they have poured out the blood of Your people (the saints) and the prophets, and You have given them blood to drink.

Blessed (happy, <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30969a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>to be envied) is he who stays awake (alert) and who guards his clothes, so that he may not be naked and [have the shame of being] seen exposed!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30970" class="sup">16</span>And they gathered them together at the place which in Hebrew is called Armageddon. [II Kings 9:27.]<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30971" class="sup">17</span>Then the seventh [angel] emptied out his bowl into the air, and a mighty voice came out of the sanctuary of heaven from the throne [of God], saying, It is done!

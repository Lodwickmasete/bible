<p><h2>2 Timothy 3</h2><span id="en-AMP-29853" class="sup">1</span>BUT UNDERSTAND this, that in the last days will come (set in) perilous times of great stress and trouble [hard to deal with and hard to bear].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29854" class="sup">2</span>For people will be lovers of self and [utterly] self-centered, lovers of money and aroused by an inordinate [greedy] desire for wealth, proud and arrogant and contemptuous boasters. They will be abusive (blasphemous, scoffing), disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy and profane.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29855" class="sup">3</span>[They will be] without natural [human] affection (callous and inhuman), relentless (admitting of no truce or appeasement); [they will be] slanderers (false accusers, troublemakers), intemperate and loose in morals and conduct, uncontrolled and fierce, haters of good.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29856" class="sup">4</span>[They will be] treacherous [betrayers], rash, [and] inflated with self-conceit. [They will be] lovers of sensual pleasures and vain amusements more than and rather than lovers of God.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29857" class="sup">5</span>For [although] they hold a form of piety (true religion), they deny and reject and are strangers to the power of it [their conduct belies the genuineness of their profession]. Avoid [all] such people [turn away from them].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29858" class="sup">6</span>For among them are those who worm their way into homes and captivate silly and weak-natured and spiritually dwarfed women, loaded down with [the burden of their] sins [and easily] swayed and led away by various evil desires and seductive impulses.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29859" class="sup">7</span>[These weak women will listen to anybody who will teach them]; they are forever inquiring and getting information, but are never able to arrive at a recognition and knowledge of the Truth.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29860" class="sup">8</span>Now just as <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-29860a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>Jannes and Jambres were hostile to and resisted Moses, so these men also are hostile to and oppose the Truth.

<p><h2>Revelation 19</h2><span id="en-AMP-31018" class="sup">1</span>AFTER THIS I heard what sounded like a mighty shout of a great crowd in heaven, exclaiming, Hallelujah (praise the Lord)! Salvation and glory (splendor and majesty) and power (dominion and authority) [belong] to our God!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-31019" class="sup">2</span>Because His judgments (His condemnation and punishment, His sentences of doom) are true and sound and just and upright. He has judged (convicted, pronounced sentence, and doomed) the great and notorious harlot (idolatress) who corrupted and demoralized and poisoned the earth with her lewdness and adultery (idolatry). And He has avenged (visited on her the penalty for) the blood of His servants at her hand.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-31019A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-31020" class="sup">3</span>And again they shouted, Hallelujah (praise the Lord)! The smoke of her [burning] shall continue to ascend forever and ever (through the eternities of the eternities).<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-31020B" title="See cross-reference B">B</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-31021" class="sup">4</span>Then the twenty-four elders [of <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-31021a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>the heavenly Sanhedrin] and the four living creatures fell prostrate and worshiped [paying divine honors to] God, Who sits on the throne, saying, Amen! Hallelujah (praise the Lord)!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-31022" class="sup">5</span>Then from the throne there came a voice, saying, Praise our God, all you servants of His, you who reverence Him, both small and great!<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-31022C" title="See cross-reference C">C</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-31023" class="sup">6</span>After that I heard what sounded like the shout of a vast throng, like the boom of many pounding waves, and like the roar of terrific and mighty peals of thunder, exclaiming, Hallelujah (praise the Lord)! For now the Lord our God the Omnipotent (the All-Ruler) reigns!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-31024" class="sup">7</span>Let us rejoice and shout for joy [exulting and triumphant]! Let us celebrate and ascribe to Him glory and honor, for the marriage of the Lamb [at last] has come, and His bride has prepared herself.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-31024D" title="See cross-reference D">D</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-31025" class="sup">8</span>She has been permitted to dress in fine (radiant) linen, dazzling and white--for the fine linen is (signifies, represents) the righteousness (the upright, just, and godly living, deeds, and conduct, and right standing with God) of the saints (God's holy people).<p />  <span id="en-AMP-31026" class="sup">9</span>Then [the angel] said to me, Write this down: Blessed (happy, <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-31026b" title=" b">b</a>]</sup>to be envied) are those who are summoned (invited, called) to the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he said to me [further], These are the true words (the genuine and exact declarations) of God.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-31027" class="sup">10</span>Then I fell prostrate at his feet to worship (to pay divine honors) to him, but he [restrained me] and said, Refrain! [You must not do that!] I am [only] another servant with you and your brethren who have [accepted and hold] the testimony borne by Jesus. Worship God! For the substance (essence) of the truth revealed by Jesus is the spirit of all prophecy [the vital breath, the inspiration of all inspired preaching and interpretation of the divine will and purpose, including both mine and yours].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-31028" class="sup">11</span>After that I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse [appeared]! The One Who was riding it is called Faithful (Trustworthy, Loyal, Incorruptible, Steady) and True, and He passes judgment and wages war in righteousness (holiness, justice, and uprightness).<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-31028E" title="See cross-reference E">E</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-31029" class="sup">12</span>His eyes [blaze] like a flame of fire, and on His head are many kingly crowns (diadems); and He has a title (name) inscribed which He alone knows or can understand.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-31029F" title="See cross-reference F">F</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-31030" class="sup">13</span>He is dressed in a robe dyed by <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-31030c" title=" c">c</a>]</sup>dipping in blood, and the title by which He is called is The Word of God.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-31031" class="sup">14</span>And the troops of heaven, clothed in fine linen, dazzling and clean, followed Him on white horses.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-31032" class="sup">15</span>From His mouth goes forth a sharp sword with which He can smite (afflict, strike) the nations; and He will shepherd and control them with a staff (scepter, rod) of iron. He will tread the winepress of the fierceness of the wrath and indignation of God the All-Ruler (the Almighty, the Omnipotent).<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-31032G" title="See cross-reference G">G</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-31033" class="sup">16</span>And on His garment (robe) and on His thigh He has a name (title) inscribed, KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-31033H" title="See cross-reference H">H</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-31034" class="sup">17</span>Then I saw a single angel stationed in the sun's <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-31034d" title=" d">d</a>]</sup>light, and with a mighty voice he shouted to all the birds that fly across the sky, Come, gather yourselves together for the great supper of God,<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-31034I" title="See cross-reference I">I</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-31035" class="sup">18</span>That you may feast on the flesh of rulers, the flesh of generals and captains, the flesh of powerful and mighty men, the flesh of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all humanity, both free and slave, both small and great!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-31036" class="sup">19</span>Then I saw the beast and the rulers and leaders of the earth with their troops mustered to go into battle and make war against Him Who is mounted on the horse and against His troops.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-31037" class="sup">20</span>And the beast was seized and overpowered, and with him the false prophet who in his presence had worked wonders and performed miracles by which he led astray those who had accepted or permitted to be placed upon them the stamp (mark) of the beast and those who paid homage and gave divine honors to his statue. Both of them were hurled alive into the fiery lake that burns and blazes with brimstone.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-31038" class="sup">21</span>And the rest were killed with the sword that issues from the mouth of Him Who is mounted on the horse, and all the birds fed ravenously and glutted themselves with their flesh.<p /> </p><p /><strong><br /><hr /><br /></strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-AMP-31021a"><a href="#en-AMP-31021" title="Go to Revelation 19:4">Revelation 19:4</a> George R.

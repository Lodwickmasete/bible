<p><h2>2 Corinthians 11</h2><span id="en-AMP-28989" class="sup">1</span>I WISH you would bear with me while I indulge in a little [so-called] foolishness. Do bear with me!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28990" class="sup">2</span>For I am <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28990a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>zealous for you with a godly eagerness and a divine jealousy, for I have betrothed you to one Husband, to present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-28990A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-28991" class="sup">3</span>But [now] I am fearful, lest that even as the serpent beguiled Eve by his cunning, so your minds may be corrupted and seduced from wholehearted and sincere and pure devotion to Christ.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-28991B" title="See cross-reference B">B</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-28992" class="sup">4</span>For [you seem readily to endure it] if a man comes and preaches another Jesus than the One we preached, or if you receive a different spirit from the [Spirit] you [once] received or a different gospel from the one you [then] received and welcomed; you tolerate [all that] well enough!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28993" class="sup">5</span>Yet I consider myself as in no way inferior to these [precious] <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28993b" title=" b">b</a>]</sup>extra-super [false] apostles.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28994" class="sup">6</span>But even if [I am] unskilled in speaking, yet [I am] not [unskilled] in knowledge [I know what I am talking about]; we have made this evident to you in all things.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28995" class="sup">7</span>But did I perhaps make a mistake and do you a wrong in debasing and cheapening myself so that you might be exalted and enriched in dignity and honor and happiness by preaching God's Gospel without expense to you?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28996" class="sup">8</span>Other churches I have robbed by accepting [more than their share of] support for my ministry [from them in order] to serve you.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28997" class="sup">9</span>And when I was with you and ran short financially, I did not burden any [of you], for what I lacked was abundantly made up by the brethren who came from Macedonia. So I kept myself from being burdensome to you in any way, and will continue to keep [myself from being so].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28998" class="sup">10</span>As the truth of Christ is in me, this my boast [of independence] shall not be debarred (silenced or checked) in the regions of Achaia (most of Greece).<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28999" class="sup">11</span>And why? Because I do not love you [do not have a preference for you, wish you well, and regard your welfare]? God perceives and knows that I do!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29000" class="sup">12</span>But what I do, I will continue to do, [for I am determined to maintain this independence] in order to cut off the claim of those who would like [to find an occasion and incentive] to claim that in their boasted [mission] they work on the same terms that we do.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29001" class="sup">13</span>For such men are false apostles [spurious, counterfeits], deceitful workmen, masquerading as apostles (special messengers) of Christ (the Messiah).<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29002" class="sup">14</span>And it is no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light;<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29003" class="sup">15</span>So it is not surprising if his servants also masquerade as ministers of righteousness. [But] their end will correspond with their deeds.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29004" class="sup">16</span>I repeat then, let no one think I have lost my wits; but even if you do, then bear with a witless man, so that I too may boast a little.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29005" class="sup">17</span>What I say by way of this confident boasting, I say not with the Lord's authority [by inspiration] but, as it were, in pure witlessness.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29006" class="sup">18</span>[For] since many boast of worldly things and according to the flesh, I will glory (boast) also.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29007" class="sup">19</span>For you readily and gladly bear with the foolish, since you are so smart and wise yourselves!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29008" class="sup">20</span>For you endure it if a man assumes control of your souls and makes slaves of you, or devours [your substance, spends your money] and preys upon you, or deceives and takes advantage of you, or is arrogant and puts on airs, or strikes you in the face.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29009" class="sup">21</span>To my discredit, I must say, we have shown ourselves too weak [for you to show such tolerance of us and for us to do strong, courageous things like that to you]! But in whatever any person is bold and dares [to boast]--mind you, I am speaking in this foolish (witless) way--I also am bold and dare [to boast].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29010" class="sup">22</span>They are Hebrews? So am I! They are Israelites? So am I! They are descendants of Abraham? So am I!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29011" class="sup">23</span>Are they [ministering] servants of Christ (the Messiah)? I am talking like one beside himself, [but] I am more, with far more extensive and abundant labors, with far more imprisonments, [beaten] with countless stripes, and frequently [at the point of] death.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29012" class="sup">24</span>Five times I received from [the hands of] the Jews forty [lashes all] but one;<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-29012C" title="See cross-reference C">C</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-29013" class="sup">25</span>Three times I have been beaten with rods; once I was stoned. Three times I have been aboard a ship wrecked at sea; a [whole] night and a day I have spent [adrift] on the deep;<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29014" class="sup">26</span>Many times on journeys, [exposed to] perils from rivers, perils from bandits, perils from [my own] nation, perils from the Gentiles, perils in the city, perils in the desert places, perils in the sea, perils from those posing as believers [but destitute of Christian knowledge and piety];<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29015" class="sup">27</span>In toil and hardship, watching often [through sleepless nights], in hunger and thirst, frequently driven to fasting by want, in cold and exposure and lack of clothing.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29016" class="sup">28</span>And besides those things that are without, there is the daily [inescapable pressure] of my care and anxiety for all the churches!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29017" class="sup">29</span>Who is weak, and I do not feel [his] weakness? Who is made to stumble and fall and have his faith hurt, and I am not on fire [with sorrow or indignation]?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29018" class="sup">30</span>If I must boast, I will boast of the things that [show] my infirmity [of the things by which I am made weak and contemptible in the eyes of my opponents].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29019" class="sup">31</span>The God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ knows, He Who is blessed and to be praised forevermore, that I do not lie.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29020" class="sup">32</span>In Damascus, the city governor acting under King Aretas guarded the city of Damascus [on purpose] to arrest me,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29021" class="sup">33</span>And I was [actually] let down in a [rope] basket or hamper through a window (a small door) in the wall, and I escaped through his fingers.<p /> </p><p /><strong><br /><hr /><br /></strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-AMP-28990a"><a href="#en-AMP-28990" title="Go to 2 Corinthians 11:2">2 Corinthians 11:2</a> G.

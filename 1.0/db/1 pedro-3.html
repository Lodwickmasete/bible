<p><h2>1 Peter 3</h2><span id="en-AMP-30424" class="sup">1</span>IN LIKE manner, you married women, be submissive to your own husbands [subordinate yourselves as being secondary to and dependent on them, and adapt yourselves to them], so that even if any do not obey the Word [of God], they may be won over not by discussion but by the [godly] lives of their wives,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30425" class="sup">2</span>When they observe the pure and modest way in which you conduct yourselves, together with your <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30425a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup> reverence [for your husband; you are to feel for him all that reverence includes: to respect, defer to, revere him--to honor, esteem, appreciate, prize, and, in the human sense, to adore him, that is, to admire, praise, be devoted to, deeply love, and enjoy your husband].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30426" class="sup">3</span>Let not yours be the [merely] external adorning with [elaborate] <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30426b" title=" b">b</a>]</sup> interweaving and knotting of the hair, the wearing of jewelry, or changes of clothes;<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30427" class="sup">4</span>But let it be the inward adorning and beauty of the hidden person of the heart, with the incorruptible and unfading charm of a gentle and peaceful spirit, which [is not anxious or wrought up, but] is very precious in the sight of God.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30428" class="sup">5</span>For it was thus that the pious women of old who hoped in God were [accustomed] to beautify themselves and were submissive to their husbands [adapting themselves to them as themselves secondary and dependent upon them].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30429" class="sup">6</span>It was thus that Sarah obeyed Abraham [following his guidance and acknowledging his headship over her by] calling him lord (master, leader, authority). And you are now her true daughters if you do right and let nothing terrify you [not giving way to hysterical fears or letting anxieties unnerve you].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30430" class="sup">7</span>In the same way you married men should live considerately with [your wives], with an <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30430c" title=" c">c</a>]</sup>intelligent recognition [of the marriage relation], honoring the woman as [physically] the weaker, but [realizing that you] are joint heirs of the grace (God's unmerited favor) of life, in order that your prayers may not be hindered and cut off. [Otherwise you cannot pray effectively.]<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30431" class="sup">8</span>Finally, all [of you] should be of one and the same mind (united in spirit), sympathizing [with one another], loving [each other] as brethren [of one household], compassionate and courteous (tenderhearted and humble).<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30432" class="sup">9</span>Never return evil for evil or insult for insult (scolding, tongue-lashing, berating), but on the contrary blessing [praying for their welfare, happiness, and protection, and truly pitying and loving them]. For know that to this you have been called, that you may yourselves inherit a blessing [from God--that you may obtain a blessing as heirs, bringing welfare and happiness and protection].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30433" class="sup">10</span>For let him who wants to enjoy life and see good days [good--whether apparent or not] keep his tongue free from evil and his lips from guile (treachery, deceit).<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30434" class="sup">11</span>Let him turn away from wickedness and shun it, and let him do right. Let him search for peace (harmony; undisturbedness from fears, agitating passions, and moral conflicts) and seek it eagerly. [Do not merely desire peaceful relations with God, with your fellowmen, and with yourself, but pursue, go after them!]<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30435" class="sup">12</span>For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous (those who are upright and in right standing with God), and His ears are attentive to their prayer. But the face of the Lord is against those who practice evil [to oppose them, to frustrate, and defeat them].<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30435A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30436" class="sup">13</span>Now who is there to hurt you if you are <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30436d" title=" d">d</a>]</sup>zealous followers of that which is good?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30437" class="sup">14</span>But even in case you should suffer for the sake of righteousness, [you are] blessed (happy, to be envied). Do not dread or be afraid of their threats, nor be disturbed [by their opposition].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30438" class="sup">15</span>But in your hearts set Christ apart as holy [and acknowledge Him] as Lord. Always be ready to give a logical defense to anyone who asks you to account for the hope that is in you, but do it courteously and respectfully.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30438B" title="See cross-reference B">B</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30439" class="sup">16</span>[And see to it that] your conscience is entirely clear (<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30439e" title=" e">e</a>]</sup>unimpaired), so that, when you are falsely accused as evildoers, those who threaten you abusively and revile your right behavior in Christ may come to be ashamed [of slandering your good lives].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30440" class="sup">17</span>For [it is] better to suffer [unjustly] for doing right, if that should be God's will, than to suffer [justly] for doing wrong.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30441" class="sup">18</span>For Christ [the Messiah Himself] died for sins once <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30441f" title=" f">f</a>]</sup>for all, the Righteous for the unrighteous (the Just for the unjust, the Innocent for the guilty), that He might bring us to God. In His human body He was put to death, but He was made alive in the spirit,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30442" class="sup">19</span>In which He went and preached to the spirits in prison,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30443" class="sup">20</span>[The souls of those] who long before in the days of Noah had been disobedient, when God's patience waited during the building of the ark in which a few [people], actually eight in number, were saved through water.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30443C" title="See cross-reference C">C</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30444" class="sup">21</span>And baptism, which is a figure [of their deliverance], does now also save you [from inward questionings and fears], not by the removing of outward body filth [bathing], but by [providing you with] the answer of a good and clear conscience (inward cleanness and peace) before God [because you are demonstrating what you believe to be yours] through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30445" class="sup">22</span>[And He] has now entered into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with [all] angels and authorities and powers made subservient to Him.<p /> </p><p /><strong><br /><hr /><br /></strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-AMP-30425a"><a href="#en-AMP-30425" title="Go to 1 Peter 3:2">1 Peter 3:2</a> Joseph Thayer, A Greek-English Lexicon.</li>

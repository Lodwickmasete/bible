<p><h2>1 Corinthians 8</h2><span id="en-AMP-28527" class="sup">1</span>NOW ABOUT food offered to idols: of course we know that all of us possess knowledge [concerning these matters. Yet mere] knowledge causes people to be puffed up (to bear themselves loftily and be proud), but love (affection and goodwill and benevolence) edifies and builds up and encourages one to grow [to his full stature].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28528" class="sup">2</span>If anyone imagines that he has come to know and understand much [of divine things, without love], he does not yet perceive and recognize and understand as strongly and clearly, nor has he become as intimately acquainted with anything as he ought or as is necessary.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28529" class="sup">3</span>But if one loves God truly [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28529a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>with affectionate reverence, prompt obedience, and grateful recognition of His blessing], he is known by God [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28529b" title=" b">b</a>]</sup>recognized as worthy of His intimacy and love, and he is owned by Him].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28530" class="sup">4</span>In this matter, then, of eating food offered to idols, we know that an idol is nothing (has no real existence) and that there is no God but one.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-28530A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-28531" class="sup">5</span>For although there may be so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth, as indeed there are many of them, both of gods and of lords and masters,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28532" class="sup">6</span>Yet for us there is [only] one God, the Father, Who is the Source of all things and for Whom we [have life], and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through and by Whom are all things and through and by Whom we [ourselves exist].<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-28532B" title="See cross-reference B">B</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-28533" class="sup">7</span>Nevertheless, not all [believers] possess this knowledge. But some, through being all their lives until now accustomed to [thinking of] idols [as real and living], still consider the food [offered to an idol] as that sacrificed to an [actual] god; and their weak consciences become defiled and injured if they eat [it].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28534" class="sup">8</span>Now food [itself] will not cause our acceptance by God nor commend us to Him. Eating [food offered to idols] gives us no advantage; neither do we come short or become any worse if we do not eat [it].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28535" class="sup">9</span>Only be careful that this power of choice (this permission and liberty to do as you please) which is yours, does not [somehow] become a hindrance (cause of stumbling) to the weak or overscrupulous [giving them an impulse to sin].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28536" class="sup">10</span>For suppose someone sees you, a man having knowledge [of God, with an intelligent view of this subject and] reclining at table in an idol's temple, might he not be encouraged and emboldened [to violate his own conscientious scruples] if he is weak and uncertain, and eat what [to him] is for the purpose of idol worship?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28537" class="sup">11</span>And so by your enlightenment (your knowledge of spiritual things), this weak man is ruined (is lost and perishes)--the brother for whom Christ (the Messiah) died!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28538" class="sup">12</span>And when you sin against your brethren in this way, wounding and damaging their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28539" class="sup">13</span>Therefore, if [my eating a] food is a cause of my brother's falling or of hindering [his spiritual advancement], I will not eat [such] flesh forever, lest I cause my brother to be tripped up and fall and to be offended.<p /> </p><p /><strong><br /><hr /><br /></strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-AMP-28529a"><a href="#en-AMP-28529" title="Go to 1 Corinthians 8:3">1 Corinthians 8:3</a> Joseph Thayer, A Greek-English Lexicon.</li>

<p><h2>1 Samuel 23</h2><span id="en-AMP-7812" class="sup">1</span>THEN THEY told David, Behold, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah and are robbing the threshing floors.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7813" class="sup">2</span>So David inquired of the Lord, Shall I go and attack these Philistines? And the Lord said to David, Go, smite the Philistines and save Keilah.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7814" class="sup">3</span>David's men said to him, Behold, we are afraid here in Judah. How much more, then, if we come to Keilah against the armies of the Philistines?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7815" class="sup">4</span>Then David inquired of the Lord again. And the Lord answered him, Arise, go down to Keilah, for I will deliver the Philistines into your hand.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7816" class="sup">5</span>So David and his men went to Keilah and fought the Philistines with a great slaughter and brought away their cattle. So David delivered the people of Keilah.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7817" class="sup">6</span>When Abiathar son of Ahimelech fled to David at Keilah, he came with an ephod in his hand.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7818" class="sup">7</span>Now it was told Saul that David had come to Keilah. Saul said, God has delivered him into my hand, for he is shut in by going into a town that has gates and bars.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7819" class="sup">8</span>Saul summoned all the men for war, to go to Keilah to besiege David and his men.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7820" class="sup">9</span>David knew that Saul was plotting evil against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring the ephod here.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7821" class="sup">10</span>Then David said, O Lord, the God of Israel, Your servant has surely heard that Saul intends to come and destroy the city of Keilah on my account.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7822" class="sup">11</span>Will the men of Keilah deliver me into his hand? Will Saul come down, as Your servant has heard? O Lord, God of Israel, I beseech You, tell Your servant. And the Lord said, He will come down.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7823" class="sup">12</span>Then David asked, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into Saul's hand? The Lord said, They will deliver you up.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7824" class="sup">13</span>Then David and his men, about 600, arose and left Keilah, going wherever they could go. When Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah, he gave up going there.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7825" class="sup">14</span>David remained in the wilderness strongholds in the hill country of the Wilderness of Ziph. Saul sought him every day, but God did not give him into his hands.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7826" class="sup">15</span>David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life. David was in the Wilderness of Ziph in the wood [at Horesh].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7827" class="sup">16</span>And Jonathan, Saul's son, rose and went into the wood to David [at Horesh] and strengthened his hand in God.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7828" class="sup">17</span>He said to him, Fear not; the hand of Saul my father shall not find you. You shall be king over Israel, and I shall be next to you. Saul my father knows that too.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7829" class="sup">18</span>And the two of them made a covenant before the Lord. And David remained in the wood [at Horesh], and Jonathan went to his house.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7830" class="sup">19</span>Then the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah, saying, Does not David hide himself with us in strongholds in the wood [at Horesh], on the hill of Hachilah, which is south of Jeshimon?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7831" class="sup">20</span>Now come down, O king, according to all your heart's desire to come down, and our part shall be to deliver him into the king's hands.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7832" class="sup">21</span>And Saul said, The Lord bless you, for you have compassion on me.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7833" class="sup">22</span>Go, make yet more sure; and know and see where his haunt is and who has seen him there; for I am told he deals very craftily.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7834" class="sup">23</span>See and take note of all his hiding places and come back to me with the certain facts, and I will go with you. If he is in the land, I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7835" class="sup">24</span>So they arose and went to Ziph ahead of Saul. Now David and his men were in the Wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah south of Jeshimon.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7836" class="sup">25</span>Saul and his men went to seek him. And David was told; so he went down to the rock in the Wilderness of Maon and stayed. When Saul heard that, he pursued David in the Wilderness of Maon.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7837" class="sup">26</span>And Saul went on one side of the mountain, and David and his men on the other side of the mountain. And David made haste to get away for fear of Saul, for Saul and his men were surrounding [him] and his men to capture them.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7838" class="sup">27</span>But a messenger came to Saul, saying, Make haste and come, for the Philistines have made a raid on the land.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7839" class="sup">28</span>So Saul returned from pursuing David and went against the Philistines. So they called that place the Rock of Escape.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7840" class="sup">29</span>David went up from there and dwelt in the strongholds of En-gedi.<p /> </p><p /><br /></div>

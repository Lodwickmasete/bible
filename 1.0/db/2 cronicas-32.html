<p><h2>2 Chronicles 32</h2><span id="en-AMP-11877" class="sup">1</span>AFTER THESE things and this loyalty, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, invaded Judah, and encamped against the fortified cities, thinking to take them.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11878" class="sup">2</span>When Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come and intended to fight against Jerusalem,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11879" class="sup">3</span>He decided with his officers and his mighty men to stop up the waters of the fountains which were outside the city [by enclosing them with masonry and concealing them], and they helped him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11880" class="sup">4</span>So many people gathered, and they stopped up all the springs and the brook which flowed through the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come and find much water?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11881" class="sup">5</span>Also Hezekiah took courage and built up all the wall that was broken, and raised towers upon it, and he built another wall outside and strengthened the Millo in the City of David and made weapons and shields in abundance.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11882" class="sup">6</span>And he set captains of war over the people and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city and spoke encouragingly to them, saying,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11883" class="sup">7</span>Be strong and courageous. Be not afraid or dismayed before the king of Assyria and all the horde that is with him, for there is Another with us greater than [all those] with him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11884" class="sup">8</span>With him is an arm of flesh, but with us is the Lord our God to help us and to fight our battles. And the people relied on the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11885" class="sup">9</span>And this Sennacherib king of Assyria, while he himself with all his forces was before Lachish, sent his servants to Jerusalem, to Hezekiah king of Judah, and to all Judah who were at Jerusalem, saying,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11886" class="sup">10</span>Thus says Sennacherib king of Assyria: On what do you trust, that you remain in the strongholds in Jerusalem?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11887" class="sup">11</span>Is not Hezekiah leading you on in order to let you die by famine and thirst, saying, The Lord our God will deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11888" class="sup">12</span>Has not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, You shall worship before one altar and burn incense upon it?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11889" class="sup">13</span>Do you not know what I and my fathers have done to all the peoples of other lands? Were the gods of the nations of those lands in any way able to deliver their lands out of my hand?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11890" class="sup">14</span>Who among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed was able to deliver his people out of my hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of my hand?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11891" class="sup">15</span>So now, do not let Hezekiah deceive or mislead you in this way, and do not believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of my hand or the hand of my fathers. How much less will your God deliver you out of my hand!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11892" class="sup">16</span>And his servants said still more against the Lord God and against His servant Hezekiah.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11893" class="sup">17</span>The Assyrian king also wrote letters insulting the Lord, the God of Israel, and speaking against Him, saying, As the gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people out of my hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver His people out of my hand.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11894" class="sup">18</span>And they shouted it loudly in the Jewish language to the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to frighten and terrify them, that they might take the city.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11895" class="sup">19</span>And they spoke of the God of Jerusalem as they spoke of the gods of the peoples of the earth, which are the work of the hands of men.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11896" class="sup">20</span>For this cause Hezekiah the king and the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz prayed and cried to heaven.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11897" class="sup">21</span>And the Lord sent an angel, who cut off all the mighty warriors and commanders and officers in the camp of the king of Assyria. So the Assyrian king returned with shamed face to his own land. And when he came into the house of his god, they who were his own offspring slew him there with the sword.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-11897A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-11898" class="sup">22</span>Thus the Lord saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria and from the hand of all his enemies, and He guided them on every side.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11899" class="sup">23</span>And many brought gifts to Jerusalem to the Lord and presents to Hezekiah king of Judah; so from then on he was magnified in the sight of all nations.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11900" class="sup">24</span>In those days Hezekiah was sick to the point of death; and he prayed to the Lord and He answered him and gave him a sign.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11901" class="sup">25</span>But Hezekiah did not make return [to the Lord] according to the benefit done to him, for his heart became proud [at such a spectacular response to his prayer]; therefore there was wrath upon him and upon Judah and Jerusalem.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11902" class="sup">26</span>But Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the Lord came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11903" class="sup">27</span>And Hezekiah had very great wealth and honor, and he made for himself treasuries for silver, gold, precious stones, spices, shields, and all kinds of attractive vessels,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11904" class="sup">28</span>Storehouses also for the increase of grain, vintage fruits, and oil, and stalls for all kinds of cattle, and sheepfolds.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11905" class="sup">29</span>Moreover, he provided for himself cities and flocks and herds in abundance, for God had given him very great possessions.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11906" class="sup">30</span>This same Hezekiah also closed the upper springs of Gihon and directed the waters down to the west side of the City of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11907" class="sup">31</span>And so in the matter of the ambassadors of the princes of Babylon who were sent to him to inquire about the wonder that was done in the land, God left him to himself to try him, that He might know all that was in his heart.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-11907B" title="See cross-reference B">B</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-11908" class="sup">32</span>Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and his good deeds, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, and in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11909" class="sup">33</span>And Hezekiah slept with his fathers and was buried in the ascent of the tombs of the descendants of David; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at his death. Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.<p /> </p><p /><strong>Cross references:</strong><ol type="A"><li id="cen-AMP-11897A"><a href="#en-AMP-11897" title="Go to 2 Chronicles 32:21">2 Chronicles 32:21</a> : I Kings 19:35-37 </li>

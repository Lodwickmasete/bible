<p><h2>Revelation 8</h2><span id="en-AMP-30828" class="sup">1</span>WHEN HE [the Lamb] broke open the seventh seal, there was silence for about half an hour in heaven.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30829" class="sup">2</span>Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and to them were given seven trumpets.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30830" class="sup">3</span>And another angel came and stood over the altar. He had a golden censer, and he was given very much incense (fragrant spices and gums which exhale perfume when burned), that he might mingle it with the prayers of all the people of God (the saints) upon the golden altar before the throne.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30830A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30831" class="sup">4</span>And the smoke of the incense (the perfume) arose in the presence of God, with the prayers of the people of God (the saints), from the hand of the angel.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30832" class="sup">5</span>So the angel took the censer and filled it with fire from the altar and cast it upon the earth. Then there followed peals of thunder and loud rumblings and blasts and noises, and flashes of lightning and an earthquake.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30832B" title="See cross-reference B">B</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30833" class="sup">6</span>Then the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to sound them.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30834" class="sup">7</span>The first angel blew [his] trumpet, and there was a storm of hail and fire mingled with blood cast upon the earth. And a third part of the earth was burned up and a third of the trees was burned up and all the green grass was burned up.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30834C" title="See cross-reference C">C</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30835" class="sup">8</span>The second angel blew [his] trumpet, and something resembling a great mountain, blazing with fire, was hurled into the sea.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30835D" title="See cross-reference D">D</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30836" class="sup">9</span>And a third of the sea was turned to blood, a third of the living creatures in the sea perished, and a third of the ships were destroyed.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30837" class="sup">10</span>The third angel blew [his] trumpet, and a huge star fell from heaven, burning like a torch, and it dropped on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water--<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30838" class="sup">11</span>And the name of the star is Wormwood. A third part of the waters was changed into wormwood, and many people died from using the water, because it had become bitter.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30839" class="sup">12</span>Then the fourth angel blew [his] trumpet, and a third of the sun was smitten, and a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that [the light of] a third of them was darkened, and a third of the daylight [itself] was withdrawn, and likewise a third [of the light] of the night was kept from shining.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30840" class="sup">13</span>Then I [looked and I] saw a solitary eagle flying in midheaven, and as it flew I heard it crying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe to those who dwell on the earth, because of the rest of the trumpet blasts which the three angels are about to sound!<p /> </p><p /><strong>Cross references:</strong><ol type="A"><li id="cen-AMP-30830A"><a href="#en-AMP-30830" title="Go to Revelation 8:3">Revelation 8:3</a> : s 141:2 </li>

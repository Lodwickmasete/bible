<p><h2>Revelation 20</h2><span id="en-AMP-31039" class="sup">1</span>THEN I saw an angel descending from heaven; he was holding the key of the Abyss (the bottomless pit) and a great chain was in his hand.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-31040" class="sup">2</span>And he gripped and overpowered the dragon, that old serpent [of primeval times], who is the devil and Satan, and [securely] bound him for a thousand years.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-31041" class="sup">3</span>Then he hurled him into the Abyss (the bottomless pit) and closed it and sealed it above him, so that he should no longer lead astray and deceive and seduce the nations until the thousand years were at an end. After that he must be liberated for a short time.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-31042" class="sup">4</span>Then I saw thrones, and sitting on them were those to whom authority to act as judges and to pass sentence was entrusted. Also I saw the souls of those who had been slain with axes [beheaded] for their witnessing to Jesus and [for preaching and testifying] for the Word of God, and who had refused to pay homage to the beast or his statue and had not accepted his mark or permitted it to be stamped on their foreheads or on their hands. And they lived again and ruled with Christ (the Messiah) a thousand years.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-31042A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-31043" class="sup">5</span>The remainder of the dead were not restored to life again until the thousand years were completed. This is the first resurrection.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-31044" class="sup">6</span>Blessed (happy, <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-31044a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>to be envied) and holy (spiritually whole, of unimpaired innocence and proved virtue) is the person who takes part (shares) in the first resurrection! Over them the second death exerts no power or authority, but they shall be ministers of God and of Christ (the Messiah), and they shall rule along with Him a thousand years.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-31045" class="sup">7</span>And when the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released from his place of confinement,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-31046" class="sup">8</span>And he will go forth to deceive and seduce and lead astray the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth--Gog and Magog--to muster them for war; their number is like the sand of the sea.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-31046B" title="See cross-reference B">B</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-31047" class="sup">9</span>And they swarmed up over the broad plain of the earth and encircled the fortress (camp) of God's people (the saints) and the beloved city; but fire descended from heaven and consumed them. [II Kings 1:10-12; Ezek. 38:2, 22.]<p />  <span id="en-AMP-31048" class="sup">10</span>Then the devil who had led them astray [deceiving and seducing them] was hurled into the fiery lake of burning brimstone, where the beast and false prophet were; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever (through the ages of the ages).<p />  <span id="en-AMP-31049" class="sup">11</span>Then I saw a great white throne and the One Who was seated upon it, from Whose presence and from the sight of Whose face earth and sky fled away, and no place was found for them.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-31050" class="sup">12</span>I [also] saw the dead, great and small; they stood before the throne, and books were opened. Then another book was opened, which is [the Book] of Life. And the dead were judged (sentenced) by what they had done [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-31050b" title=" b">b</a>]</sup>their whole way of feeling and acting, their aims and endeavors] in accordance with what was recorded in the books.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-31051" class="sup">13</span>And the sea delivered up the dead who were in it, death and Hades (<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-31051c" title=" c">c</a>]</sup>the state of death or disembodied existence) surrendered the dead in them, and all were tried and their cases determined by what they had done [according to their motives, aims, and works].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-31052" class="sup">14</span>Then death and Hades (<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-31052d" title=" d">d</a>]</sup>the state of death or disembodied existence) were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-31053" class="sup">15</span>And if anyone's [name] was not found recorded in the Book of Life, he was hurled into the lake of fire.<p /> </p><p /><strong><br /><hr /><br /></strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-AMP-31044a"><a href="#en-AMP-31044" title="Go to Revelation 20:6">Revelation 20:6</a> Alexander Souter, Pocket Lexicon.</li>

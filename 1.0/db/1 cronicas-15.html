<p><h2>1 Chronicles 15</h2><span id="en-AMP-10793" class="sup">1</span>DAVID MADE for himself houses in the City of David, and he prepared a place for the ark of God and pitched a tent for it.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10794" class="sup">2</span>Then David said, None should carry the ark of God but the Levites, for the Lord chose them to carry the ark of God and to minister to Him forever.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10795" class="sup">3</span>And David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the Lord to its place, which he had prepared for it.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10796" class="sup">4</span>And David gathered together the sons of Aaron and the Levites:<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10797" class="sup">5</span>Of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, with 120 kinsmen;<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10798" class="sup">6</span>Of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, with 220 kinsmen;<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10799" class="sup">7</span>Of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief, with 130 kinsmen;<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10800" class="sup">8</span>Of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief, with 200 kinsmen;<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10801" class="sup">9</span>Of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief, with 80 kinsmen;<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10802" class="sup">10</span>Of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, with 112 kinsmen.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10803" class="sup">11</span>And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites--Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10804" class="sup">12</span>And said to them, You are the heads of the fathers' houses of the Levites; sanctify yourselves, both you and your brethren, that you may bring up the ark of the Lord, the God of Israel, to the place that I have prepared for it.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10805" class="sup">13</span>For because you bore it not [as God directed] at the first, the Lord our God broke forth upon us--because we did not seek Him in the way He ordained.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-10805A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-10806" class="sup">14</span>So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the Lord, the God of Israel.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10807" class="sup">15</span>The Levites carried the ark of God on their shoulders with the poles, as Moses commanded by the word of the Lord.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10808" class="sup">16</span>David told the chief Levites to appoint their brethren the singers with instruments of music--harps, lyres, and cymbals--to play loudly and lift up their voices with joy.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10809" class="sup">17</span>So the Levites appointed Heman son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan son of Kushaiah;<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10810" class="sup">18</span>And with them their brethren of the second class: Zechariah, Ben, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, and also the gatekeepers, Obed-edom and Jeiel.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10811" class="sup">19</span>So the singers Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed to sound bronze cymbals;<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10812" class="sup">20</span>Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah were to play harps [resembling guitars] set to Alamoth [probably the treble voice];<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10813" class="sup">21</span>Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah were to lead with lyres set to Sheminith [the bass voice].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10814" class="sup">22</span>Chenaniah, leader of the Levites in singing, was put in charge of carrying the ark and lifting up song. He instructed about these matters because he was skilled and able.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10815" class="sup">23</span>Berechiah and Elkanah were gatekeepers for the ark.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10816" class="sup">24</span>Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer the priests were to blow the trumpets before the ark of God. And Obed-edom and Jehiah (Jeiel) were also gatekeepers for the ark.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10817" class="sup">25</span>So David, the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the house of Obed-edom with joy.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10818" class="sup">26</span>And when God helped the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord [with a safe start], they offered seven bulls and seven rams.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10819" class="sup">27</span>David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, as were the Levites who bore the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah, director of the music of the singers. David also wore an ephod [a priestly upper garment] of linen.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10820" class="sup">28</span>Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the Lord with shouting, sound of the cornet, trumpets, and cymbals, sounding aloud with harps and lyres.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10821" class="sup">29</span>As the ark of the covenant of the Lord came to the City of David, Michal [David's wife] daughter of Saul, looking from a window, saw King David leaping as in sport, and she despised him in her heart.<p /> </p><p /><strong>Cross references:</strong><ol type="A"><li id="cen-AMP-10805A"><a href="#en-AMP-10805" title="Go to 1 Chronicles 15:13">1 Chronicles 15:13</a> : um 1:50; I Chron 13:7-10 </li>

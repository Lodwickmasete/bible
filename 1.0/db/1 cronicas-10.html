But his armor-bearer would not, for he was terrified. So Saul took his own sword and fell on it.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10665" class="sup">5</span>When his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell on his sword and died.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10666" class="sup">6</span>So Saul died; he and his three sons and all his house died together.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10667" class="sup">7</span>And when all the men of Israel who were in the valley saw that the army had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook their cities and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10668" class="sup">8</span>The next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount Gilboa.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10669" class="sup">9</span>They stripped [Saul] and took his head and his armor, and sent [them] round about in Philistia to carry the news to their idols and to the people.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10670" class="sup">10</span>And they put [Saul's] armor in the house of their gods and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10671" class="sup">11</span>When all Jabesh-gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10672" class="sup">12</span>All the brave men arose, took away the bodies of Saul and his sons, brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh; then they fasted seven days.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-10672A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-10673" class="sup">13</span>So Saul died for his trespass against the Lord [in sparing Amalek], for his unfaithfulness in not keeping God's word, and also for consulting [a medium with] a spirit of the dead to inquire pleadingly of it,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10674" class="sup">14</span>And inquired not so of the Lord [in earnest penitence].

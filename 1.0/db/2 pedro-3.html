<p><h2>2 Peter 3</h2><span id="en-AMP-30522" class="sup">1</span>BELOVED, I am now writing you this second letter. In [both of] them I have stirred up your unsullied (sincere) mind by way of remembrance,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30523" class="sup">2</span>That you should recall the predictions of the holy (consecrated, dedicated) prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior [given] through your apostles (His special messengers).<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30524" class="sup">3</span>To begin with, you must know and understand this, that scoffers (mockers) will come in the last days with scoffing, [people who] walk after their own fleshly desires<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30525" class="sup">4</span>And say, Where is the promise of His coming? For since the forefathers fell asleep, all things have continued exactly as they did from the beginning of creation.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30526" class="sup">5</span>For they willfully overlook and forget this [fact], that the heavens [came into] existence long ago by the word of God, and the earth also which was formed out of water and by means of water,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30527" class="sup">6</span>Through which the world that then [existed] was deluged with water and perished.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30527A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30528" class="sup">7</span>But by the same word the present heavens and earth have been stored up (reserved) for fire, being kept until the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly people.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30529" class="sup">8</span>Nevertheless, do not let this one fact escape you, beloved, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30529B" title="See cross-reference B">B</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30530" class="sup">9</span>The Lord does not delay and is not tardy or slow about what He promises, according to some people's conception of slowness, but He is long-suffering (extraordinarily patient) toward you, not desiring that any should perish, but that all should turn to repentance.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30531" class="sup">10</span>But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, and then the heavens will vanish (pass away) with a thunderous crash, and the [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30531a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>material] elements [of the universe] will be dissolved with fire, and the earth and the works that are upon it will be burned up.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30532" class="sup">11</span>Since all these things are thus <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30532b" title=" b">b</a>]</sup>in the process of being dissolved, what kind of person ought [each of] you to be [in the meanwhile] in consecrated and holy behavior and devout and godly qualities,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30533" class="sup">12</span>While you wait and earnestly long for (expect and hasten) the coming of the day of God by reason of which the flaming heavens will be dissolved, and the [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30533c" title=" c">c</a>]</sup>material] elements [of the universe] will flare and melt with fire?<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30533C" title="See cross-reference C">C</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30534" class="sup">13</span>But we look for new heavens and a new earth according to His promise, in which righteousness (uprightness, freedom from sin, and right standing with God) is to abide.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30534D" title="See cross-reference D">D</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30535" class="sup">14</span>So, beloved, since you are expecting these things, be eager to be found by Him [at His coming] without spot or blemish and at peace [in serene confidence, <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30535d" title=" d">d</a>]</sup>free from fears and agitating passions and moral conflicts].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30536" class="sup">15</span>And consider that the long-suffering of our Lord [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30536e" title=" e">e</a>]</sup>His slowness in avenging wrongs and judging the world] is salvation (<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30536f" title=" f">f</a>]</sup>that which is conducive to the soul's safety), even as our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you according to the spiritual insight given him,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30537" class="sup">16</span>Speaking of this as he does in all of his letters. There are some things in those [epistles of Paul] that are difficult to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist and misconstrue to their own <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30537g" title=" g">g</a>]</sup>utter destruction, just as [they distort and misinterpret] the rest of the Scriptures.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30538" class="sup">17</span>Let me warn you therefore, beloved, that knowing these things beforehand, you should be on your guard, lest you be carried away by the error of lawless and wicked [persons and] fall from your own [present] firm condition [your own steadfastness of mind].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30539" class="sup">18</span>But grow in grace (undeserved favor, spiritual strength) and <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30539h" title=" h">h</a>]</sup>recognition and knowledge and understanding of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ (the Messiah). To Him [be] glory (honor, majesty, and splendor) both now and to the day of eternity. Amen (so be it)! </p><p /><strong><br /><hr /><br /></strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-AMP-30531a"><a href="#en-AMP-30531" title="Go to 2 Peter 3:10">2 Peter 3:10</a> G.

<p><h2>1 Kings 15</h2><span id="en-AMP-9251" class="sup">1</span>IN THE eighteenth year of King Jeroboam son of Nebat, Abijam began to reign over Judah.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9252" class="sup">2</span>He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother was Maacah (Micaiah) daughter [granddaughter] of Abishalom (Absalom).<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9253" class="sup">3</span>He walked in all the sins of his father [Rehoboam] before him; and his heart was not blameless with the Lord his God, as the heart of David his father [forefather].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9254" class="sup">4</span>Nevertheless, for David's sake the Lord his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem, setting up his son after him and establishing Jerusalem,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9255" class="sup">5</span>Because David did what was right in the eyes of the Lord and turned not aside from anything that He commanded him all the days of his life, except in the matter of Uriah the Hittite.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9256" class="sup">6</span>There was war between [Abijam's father] Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of [Rehoboam's] life.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9257" class="sup">7</span>The rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9258" class="sup">8</span>Abijam slept with his fathers and they buried him in the City of David. Asa his son reigned in his stead.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9259" class="sup">9</span>In the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel, Asa began to reign over Judah.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9260" class="sup">10</span>Forty-one years he reigned in Jerusalem. His mother was [also named] Maacah (Micaiah) daughter of Abishalom (Absalom).<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-9260A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-9261" class="sup">11</span>And Asa did right in the eyes of the Lord, as did David his father [forefather].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9262" class="sup">12</span>He put away the sodomites (male cult prostitutes) out of the land and removed all the idols that his fathers [Solomon, Rehoboam, and Abijam] had made or promoted.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-9262B" title="See cross-reference B">B</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-9263" class="sup">13</span>Also Maacah his mother he removed from being queen mother, because she had an image made for [the goddess] Asherah. Asa destroyed her image, burning it by the brook Kidron.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9264" class="sup">14</span>But the high places were not removed. Yet Asa's heart was blameless with the Lord all his days.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9265" class="sup">15</span>He brought the things which his father had dedicated and the things which he himself had dedicated into the house of the Lord--silver, gold, and vessels.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9266" class="sup">16</span>There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9267" class="sup">17</span>Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah and built up Ramah, that he might allow no one to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9268" class="sup">18</span>Then Asa took all the silver and gold left in the treasuries of the house of the Lord and of the king's house and delivered them into the hands of his servants. And King Asa sent them to Ben-hadad son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, who dwelt at Damascus, saying,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9269" class="sup">19</span>Let there be a league between me and you, as was between my father and your father. Behold, I am sending you a present of silver and gold; go, break your league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may withdraw from me.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9270" class="sup">20</span>So Ben-hadad hearkened to king Asa and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon, Dan, Abel-beth-maacah, and all Chinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9271" class="sup">21</span>When Baasha heard of it, he quit building up Ramah and dwelt in Tirzah.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9272" class="sup">22</span>Then King Asa made a proclamation to all Judah--none was exempted. They carried away the stones of Ramah and its timber with which Baasha had been building. And King Asa built up with them Geba of Benjamin, and also Mizpah.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9273" class="sup">23</span>The rest of all the acts of Asa, all his might, all that he did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? But in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9274" class="sup">24</span>Asa slept with his fathers and was buried with them in the city of David his father. Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9275" class="sup">25</span>Nadab son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned two years.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9276" class="sup">26</span>He did evil in the sight of the Lord and walked in the way of his father and in his sin, with which he made Israel sin.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9277" class="sup">27</span>Baasha son of Ahijah of the house of Issachar conspired against Nadab, and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines, for Nadab and all Israel were laying siege to Gibbethon.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9278" class="sup">28</span>In the third year of Asa king of Judah Baasha slew Nadab and reigned in his stead.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9279" class="sup">29</span>As soon as he was king, Baasha killed all the household of Jeroboam. He left to [it] not one who breathed, until he had destroyed it, according to the word of the Lord which He spoke by His servant Ahijah the Shilonite--<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-9279C" title="See cross-reference C">C</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-9280" class="sup">30</span>Because of the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned and by which he made Israel to sin, and because of his provocation of the Lord, the God of Israel, to anger.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9281" class="sup">31</span>The rest of Nadab's acts, and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9282" class="sup">32</span>There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9283" class="sup">33</span>In the third year of Asa king of Judah, Baasha son of Ahijah began his reign of twenty-four years over all Israel in Tirzah.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9284" class="sup">34</span>He did evil in the sight of the Lord and walked in the way of Jeroboam and in his sin, with which he made Israel sin.<p /> </p><p /><strong>Cross references:</strong><ol type="A"><li id="cen-AMP-9260A"><a href="#en-AMP-9260" title="Go to 1 Kings 15:10">1 Kings 15:10</a> :  Kings 15:2 </li>

<p><h2>Amos 7</h2><span id="en-AMP-22466" class="sup">1</span>THUS THE Lord God showed me [Amos], and behold, He formed locusts in the beginning of the shooting up of the second crop, and behold, it was the second crop after the king's mowings.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-22467" class="sup">2</span>And when [the locusts] had finished eating the plants of the land, then I said, O Lord God, forgive, I pray You. How can Jacob stand? For he is so small!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-22468" class="sup">3</span>The Lord relented and revoked this sentence: It shall not take place, said the Lord [and He was eased and comforted concerning it].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-22469" class="sup">4</span>Thus the Lord God showed me, and behold, the Lord God called for punishment with fire, and it devoured the great deep and would have eaten up the land.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-22470" class="sup">5</span>Then said I, O Lord God, cease, I pray You! How can Jacob stand? He is so little!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-22471" class="sup">6</span>The Lord relented and revoked this sentence: This also shall not be, said the Lord [and He was eased and comforted concerning it].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-22472" class="sup">7</span>Thus He showed me, and behold, the Lord stood upon a wall with a plumb line, with a plumb line in His hand.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-22472A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-22473" class="sup">8</span>And the Lord said to me, Amos, what do you see? And I said, A plumb line. Then said the Lord, Behold, I am setting a plumb line as a standard in the midst of My people Israel. I will not pass by and spare them any more [the door of mercy is shut].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-22474" class="sup">9</span>And the [idolatrous] high places of Isaac (Israel) shall be desolate and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste, and I will rise with the sword against the house of King Jeroboam [who set up the golden calf shrines].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-22475" class="sup">10</span>Then Amaziah the priest of [the golden calf shrine at] Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel; the land is not able to bear all his words.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-22475B" title="See cross-reference B">B</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-22476" class="sup">11</span>For thus Amos has said, Jeroboam shall die by the sword and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-22477" class="sup">12</span>Also Amaziah said to Amos, O you seer, go! Flee back to the land of Judah [your own country], and eat your bread and live out your profession as a prophet there [as I perform my duties here].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-22478" class="sup">13</span>But do not prophesy any more at Bethel, for it is the king's sanctuary and a seat of his kingdom.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-22478C" title="See cross-reference C">C</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-22479" class="sup">14</span>Then Amos said to Amaziah, I was no prophet [by profession]! Neither was I a prophet's son; [but I had my occupation] I was a herdsman and a dresser of sycamore trees and a gatherer of sycamore figs.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-22480" class="sup">15</span>And the Lord took me as I followed the flock and the Lord said to me, Go, prophesy to My people Israel.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-22481" class="sup">16</span>Now therefore listen to the word of the Lord: You say, Do not prophesy against Israel and drop no statements not complimentary to the house of Isaac.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-22482" class="sup">17</span>Therefore thus says the Lord: Your wife shall be a harlot in the city and your sons and your daughters shall fall by the sword, and your land shall be divided up by line; you yourself shall die in an unclean and defiled land, and Israel shall surely go forth out of his land into exile.<p /> </p><p /><strong>Cross references:</strong><ol type="A"><li id="cen-AMP-22472A"><a href="#en-AMP-22472" title="Go to Amos 7:7">Amos 7:7</a> : I Kings 21:13; Isa 34:11 </li>

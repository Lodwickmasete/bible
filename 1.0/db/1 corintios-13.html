<p><h2>1 Corinthians 13</h2><span id="en-AMP-28665" class="sup">1</span>IF I [can] speak in the tongues of men and [even] of angels, but have not love (that reasoning, intentional, spiritual devotion such <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28665a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>as is inspired by God's love for and in us), I am only a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28666" class="sup">2</span>And if I have prophetic powers (<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28666b" title=" b">b</a>]</sup>the gift of interpreting the divine will and purpose), and understand all the secret truths and mysteries and possess all knowledge, and if I have [sufficient] faith so that I can remove mountains, but have not love (God's love in me) I am nothing (a useless nobody).<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28667" class="sup">3</span>Even if I dole out all that I have [to the poor in providing] food, and if I surrender my body to be burned or <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28667c" title=" c">c</a>]</sup> in order that I may glory, but have not love (God's love in me), I gain nothing.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28668" class="sup">4</span>Love endures long and is patient and kind; love never is envious nor boils over with jealousy, is not boastful or vainglorious, does not display itself haughtily.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28669" class="sup">5</span>It is not conceited (arrogant and inflated with pride); it is not rude (unmannerly) and does not act unbecomingly. Love (God's love in us) does not insist on its own rights or its own way, for it is not self-seeking; it is not touchy or fretful or resentful; it takes no account of the evil done to it [it pays no attention to a suffered wrong].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28670" class="sup">6</span>It does not rejoice at injustice and unrighteousness, but rejoices when right and truth prevail.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28671" class="sup">7</span>Love bears up under anything and everything that comes, is ever ready to believe the best of every person, its hopes are fadeless under all circumstances, and it endures everything [without weakening].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28672" class="sup">8</span>Love never fails [never fades out or becomes obsolete or comes to an end]. As for prophecy (<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28672d" title=" d">d</a>]</sup>the gift of interpreting the divine will and purpose), it will be fulfilled and pass away; as for tongues, they will be destroyed and cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away [it will lose its value and be superseded by truth].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28673" class="sup">9</span>For our knowledge is fragmentary (incomplete and imperfect), and our prophecy (our teaching) is fragmentary (incomplete and imperfect).<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28674" class="sup">10</span>But when the complete and perfect (total) comes, the incomplete and imperfect will vanish away (become antiquated, void, and superseded).<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28675" class="sup">11</span>When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child; now that I have become a man, I am done with childish ways and have put them aside.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28676" class="sup">12</span>For now we are looking in a mirror that gives only a dim (blurred) reflection [of reality as <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28676e" title=" e">e</a>]</sup>in a riddle or enigma], but then [when perfection comes] we shall see in reality and face to face! Now I know in part (imperfectly), but then I shall know and understand <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28676f" title=" f">f</a>]</sup>fully and clearly, even in the same manner as I have been <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28676g" title=" g">g</a>]</sup>fully and clearly known and understood [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28676h" title=" h">h</a>]</sup>by God].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28677" class="sup">13</span>And so faith, hope, love abide [faith--conviction and belief respecting man's relation to God and divine things; hope--joyful and confident expectation of eternal salvation; love--true affection for God and man, growing out of God's love for and in us], these three; but the greatest of these is love.<p /> </p><p /><strong><br /><hr /><br /></strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-AMP-28665a"><a href="#en-AMP-28665" title="Go to 1 Corinthians 13:1">1 Corinthians 13:1</a> Alexander Souter, Pocket Lexicon.</li>

<p><h2>Revelation 6</h2><span id="en-AMP-30794" class="sup">1</span>THEN I saw as the Lamb broke open one of the seven seals, and as if in a voice of thunder I heard one of the four living creatures call out, Come!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30795" class="sup">2</span>And I looked, and saw there a white horse whose rider carried a bow. And a crown was given him, and he rode forth conquering and to conquer.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30795A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30796" class="sup">3</span>And when He broke the second seal, I heard the second living creature call out, Come!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30797" class="sup">4</span>And another horse came out, flaming red. And its rider was empowered to take the peace from the earth, so that men slaughtered one another; and he was given a huge sword.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30798" class="sup">5</span>When He broke open the third seal, I heard the third living creature call out, Come and look ! And I saw, and behold, a black horse, and in his hand the rider had a pair of scales (a balance).<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30799" class="sup">6</span>And I heard what seemed to be a voice from the midst of the four living creatures, saying, A quart of wheat for a denarius [a whole day's wages], and three quarts of barley for a denarius; but do not harm the oil and the wine! [II Kings 6:25.]<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30800" class="sup">7</span>When the Lamb broke open the fourth seal, I heard the fourth living creature call out, Come!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30801" class="sup">8</span>So I looked, and behold, an ashy pale horse [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30801a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>black and blue as if made so by bruising], and its rider's name was Death, and Hades (the realm of the dead) followed him closely. And they were given authority and power over a fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword and with famine and with plague (pestilence, disease) and with wild beasts of the earth.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30801B" title="See cross-reference B">B</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30802" class="sup">9</span>When the Lamb broke open the fifth seal, I saw at the foot of the altar the souls of those whose lives had been sacrificed for [adhering to] the Word of God and for the testimony they had borne.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30803" class="sup">10</span>They cried in a loud voice, O [Sovereign] Lord, holy and true, how long now before You will sit in judgment and avenge our blood upon those who dwell on the earth?<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30803C" title="See cross-reference C">C</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30804" class="sup">11</span>Then they were each given a <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30804b" title=" b">b</a>]</sup>long and flowing and festive white robe and told to rest and wait patiently a little while longer, until the number should be complete of their fellow servants and their brethren who were to be killed as they themselves had been.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30805" class="sup">12</span>When He [the Lamb] broke open the sixth seal, I looked, and there was a great earthquake; and the sun grew black as sackcloth of hair, [the full disc of] the moon became like blood.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30805D" title="See cross-reference D">D</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30806" class="sup">13</span>And the stars of the sky dropped to the earth like a fig tree shedding its unripe fruit out of season when shaken by a strong wind.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30806E" title="See cross-reference E">E</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30807" class="sup">14</span>And the <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30807c" title=" c">c</a>]</sup>sky rolled up like a scroll and vanished, and every mountain and island was dislodged from its place.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30808" class="sup">15</span>Then the kings of the earth and their noblemen and their magnates and their military chiefs and the wealthy and the strong and [everyone, whether] slave or free hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains,<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30808F" title="See cross-reference F">F</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30809" class="sup">16</span>And they called to the mountains and the rocks, Fall on (before) us and hide us from the face of Him Who sits on the throne and from the <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30809d" title=" d">d</a>]</sup>deep-seated indignation and wrath of the Lamb.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30809G" title="See cross-reference G">G</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30810" class="sup">17</span>For the great day of His wrath (vengeance, retribution, indignation) has come, and who is able to stand before it?<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30810H" title="See cross-reference H">H</a>)</sup><p /> </p><p /><strong><br /><hr /><br /></strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-AMP-30801a"><a href="#en-AMP-30801" title="Go to Revelation 6:8">Revelation 6:8</a> A description of the livid, ashen, discolored appearance of the dead; it symbolizes death and pestilence.</li>

<p><h2>Revelation 4</h2><span id="en-AMP-30769" class="sup">1</span>AFTER THIS I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven! And the first voice which I had heard addressing me like [the calling of] a <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30769a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>war trumpet said, Come up here, and I will show you what must take place in the future.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30770" class="sup">2</span>At once I came under the [Holy] Spirit's power, and behold, a throne stood in heaven, with One seated on the throne!<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30770A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30771" class="sup">3</span>And He Who sat there appeared like [the crystalline brightness of] jasper and [the fiery] sardius, and encircling the throne there was a halo that looked like [a rainbow of] emerald.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30771B" title="See cross-reference B">B</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30772" class="sup">4</span>Twenty-four other thrones surrounded the throne, and seated on these thrones were twenty-four elders (<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30772b" title=" b">b</a>]</sup>the members of the heavenly Sanhedrin), arrayed in white clothing, with crowns of gold upon their heads.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30773" class="sup">5</span>Out from the throne came flashes of lightning and rumblings and peals of thunder, and in front of the throne seven blazing torches burned, which are the seven Spirits of God [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30773c" title=" c">c</a>]</sup>the sevenfold Holy Spirit];<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30774" class="sup">6</span>And in front of the throne there was also what looked like a transparent glassy sea, as if of crystal. And around the throne, in the center at each side of the throne, were four living creatures (beings) who were full of eyes in front and behind [with intelligence as to what is before and at the rear of them].<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30774C" title="See cross-reference C">C</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30775" class="sup">7</span>The first living creature (being) was like a lion, the second living creature like an ox, the third living creature had the face of a man, and the fourth living creature [was] like a flying eagle.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30775D" title="See cross-reference D">D</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30776" class="sup">8</span>And the four living creatures, individually having six wings, were full of eyes all over and within [underneath their wings]; and day and night they never stop saying, Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty (Omnipotent), Who was and Who is and Who is to come.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30776E" title="See cross-reference E">E</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30777" class="sup">9</span>And whenever the living creatures offer glory and honor and thanksgiving to Him Who sits on the throne, Who lives forever and ever (through the eternities of the eternities),<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30777F" title="See cross-reference F">F</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30778" class="sup">10</span>The twenty-four elders (<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30778d" title=" d">d</a>]</sup>the members of the heavenly Sanhedrin) fall prostrate before Him Who is sitting on the throne, and they worship Him Who lives forever and ever; and they throw down their crowns before the throne, crying out,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30779" class="sup">11</span>Worthy are You, our Lord and God, to receive the glory and the honor and dominion, for You created all things; by Your will they were [brought into being] and were created.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30779G" title="See cross-reference G">G</a>)</sup><p /> </p><p /><strong><br /><hr /><br /></strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-AMP-30769a"><a href="#en-AMP-30769" title="Go to Revelation 4:1">Revelation 4:1</a> Marvin Vincent, Word Studies.</li>

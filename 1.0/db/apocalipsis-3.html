In case you will not rouse yourselves and keep awake and watch, I will come upon you like a thief, and you will not know or suspect at what hour I will come.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30750" class="sup">4</span>Yet you still have a few [persons'] names in Sardis who have not soiled their clothes, and they shall walk with Me in white, because they are worthy and deserving.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30751" class="sup">5</span>Thus shall he who conquers (is victorious) be clad in white garments, and I will not erase or blot out his name from the Book of Life; I will acknowledge him [as Mine] and I will confess his name openly before My Father and before His angels.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30751A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30752" class="sup">6</span>He who is able to hear, let him listen to and heed what the [Holy] Spirit says to the assemblies (churches).<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30753" class="sup">7</span>And to the angel (messenger) of the assembly (church) in Philadelphia write: These are the words of the Holy One, the True One, He Who has the key of David, Who opens and no one shall shut, Who shuts and no one shall open:<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30753B" title="See cross-reference B">B</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30754" class="sup">8</span>I know your [record of] works and what you are doing.

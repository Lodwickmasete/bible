<p><h2>1 Corinthians 9</h2><span id="en-AMP-28540" class="sup">1</span>AM I not an apostle (a special messenger)? Am I not free (unrestrained and exempt from any obligation)? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you [yourselves] not [the product and proof of] my workmanship in the Lord?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28541" class="sup">2</span>Even if I am not considered an apostle (a special messenger) by others, at least I am one to you; for you are the seal (the certificate, the living evidence) of my apostleship in the Lord [confirming and authenticating it].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28542" class="sup">3</span>This is my [real ground of] defense (my vindication of myself) to those who would put me on trial and cross-examine me.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28543" class="sup">4</span>Have we not the right to our food and drink [at the expense of the churches]?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28544" class="sup">5</span>Have we not the right also to take along with us a Christian sister as wife, as do the other apostles and the Lord's brothers and Cephas (Peter)?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28545" class="sup">6</span>Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to refrain from doing manual labor for a livelihood [in order to go about the work of the ministry]?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28546" class="sup">7</span>[Consider this:] What soldier at any time serves at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat any of the fruit of it? Who tends a flock and does not partake of the milk of the flock?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28547" class="sup">8</span>Do I say this only on human authority and as a man reasons? Does not the Law endorse the same principle?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28548" class="sup">9</span>For in the Law of Moses it is written, You shall not muzzle an ox when it is treading out the corn. Is it [only] for oxen that God cares?<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-28548A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-28549" class="sup">10</span>Or does He speak certainly and entirely for our sakes? [Assuredly] it is written for our sakes, because the plowman ought to plow in hope, and the thresher ought to thresh in expectation of partaking of the harvest.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28550" class="sup">11</span>If we have sown [the seed of] spiritual good among you, [is it too] much if we reap from your material benefits?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28551" class="sup">12</span>If others share in this rightful claim upon you, do not we [have a still better and greater claim]? However, we have never exercised this right, but we endure everything rather than put a hindrance in the way [of the spread] of the good news (the Gospel) of Christ.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28552" class="sup">13</span>Do you not know that those men who are employed in the services of the temple get their food from the temple? And that those who tend the altar share with the altar [in the offerings brought]?<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-28552B" title="See cross-reference B">B</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-28553" class="sup">14</span>[On the same principle] the Lord directed that those who publish the good news (the Gospel) should live (get their maintenance) by the Gospel.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28554" class="sup">15</span>But I have not made use of any of these privileges, nor am I writing this [to suggest] that any such provision be made for me [now]. For it would be better for me to die than to have anyone make void and deprive me of my [ground for] glorifying [in this matter].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28555" class="sup">16</span>For if I [merely] preach the Gospel, that gives me no reason to boast, for I feel compelled of necessity to do it. Woe is me if I do not preach the glad tidings (the Gospel)!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28556" class="sup">17</span>For if I do this work of my own free will, then I have my pay (my reward); but if it is not of my own will, but is done reluctantly and under compulsion, I am [still] entrusted with a [sacred] trusteeship and commission.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28557" class="sup">18</span>What then is the [actual] reward that I get? Just this: that in my preaching the good news (the Gospel), I may offer it [absolutely] free of expense [to anybody], not taking advantage of my rights and privileges [as a preacher] of the Gospel.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28558" class="sup">19</span>For although I am free in every way from anyone's control, I have made myself a bond servant to everyone, so that I might gain the more [for Christ].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28559" class="sup">20</span>To the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might win Jews; to men under the Law, [I became] as one under the Law, though not myself being under the Law, that I might win those under the Law.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28560" class="sup">21</span>To those without (outside) law I became as one without law, not that I am without the law of God and lawless toward Him, but that I am [especially keeping] within and committed to the law of Christ, that I might win those who are without law.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28561" class="sup">22</span>To the weak (wanting in discernment) I have become weak (wanting in discernment) that I might win the weak and overscrupulous. I have [in short] become all things to all men, that I might by all means (at all costs and in any and every way) save some [by winning them to faith in Jesus Christ].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28562" class="sup">23</span>And I do this for the sake of the good news (the Gospel), in order that I may become a participator in it and share in its [blessings along with you].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28563" class="sup">24</span>Do you not know that in a race all the runners compete, but [only] one receives the prize? So run [your race] that you may lay hold [of the prize] and make it yours.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28564" class="sup">25</span>Now every athlete who goes into training conducts himself temperately and restricts himself in all things. They do it to win a wreath that will soon wither, but we [do it to receive a crown of eternal blessedness] that cannot wither.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28565" class="sup">26</span>Therefore I do not run uncertainly (without definite aim). I do not box like one beating the air and striking without an adversary.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28566" class="sup">27</span>But [like a boxer] I buffet my body [handle it roughly, discipline it by hardships] and subdue it, for fear that after proclaiming to others the Gospel and things pertaining to it, I myself should become unfit [not stand the test, be unapproved and rejected as a counterfeit].<p /> </p><p /><strong>Cross references:</strong><ol type="A"><li id="cen-AMP-28548A"><a href="#en-AMP-28548" title="Go to 1 Corinthians 9:9">1 Corinthians 9:9</a> : eut 25:4 </li>

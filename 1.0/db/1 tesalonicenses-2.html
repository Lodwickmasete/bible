<p><h2>1 Thessalonians 2</h2><span id="en-AMP-29570" class="sup">1</span>FOR YOU yourselves know, brethren, that our coming among you was not useless and fruitless.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29571" class="sup">2</span>But though we had already suffered and been outrageously treated at Philippi, as you know, yet in [the strength of] our God we summoned courage to proclaim to you unfalteringly the good news (the Gospel) with earnest contention and much conflict and great opposition.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29572" class="sup">3</span>For our appeal [in preaching] does not [originate] from delusion or error or impure purpose or motive, nor in fraud or deceit.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29573" class="sup">4</span>But just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the glad tidings (the Gospel), so we speak not to please men but to please God, Who tests our hearts [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-29573a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>expecting them to be approved].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29574" class="sup">5</span>For as you well know, we never resorted either to words of flattery or to any cloak to conceal greedy motives or pretexts for gain, [as] God is our witness.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29575" class="sup">6</span>Nor did we seek to extract praise and honor and glory from men, either from you or from anyone else, though we might have asserted our authority [stood on our dignity and claimed honor] as apostles (special missionaries) of Christ (the Messiah).<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29576" class="sup">7</span>But we behaved gently when we were among you, like a devoted mother nursing and cherishing her own children.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29577" class="sup">8</span>So, being thus tenderly and affectionately desirous of you, we continued to share with you not only God's good news (the Gospel) but also our own lives as well, for you had become so very dear to us.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29578" class="sup">9</span>For you recall our hard toil and struggles, brethren. We worked night and day [and plied our trade] in order not to be a burden to any of you [for our support] while we proclaimed the glad tidings (the Gospel) of God to you.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29579" class="sup">10</span>You are witnesses, [yes] and God [also], how unworldly and upright and blameless was our behavior toward you believers [who adhered to and trusted in and relied on our Lord Jesus Christ].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29580" class="sup">11</span>For you know how, as a father [dealing with] his children, we used to exhort each of you personally, stimulating and encouraging and charging you<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29581" class="sup">12</span>To live lives worthy of God, Who calls you into His own kingdom and the glorious blessedness [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-29581b" title=" b">b</a>]</sup>into which true believers will enter after Christ's return].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29582" class="sup">13</span>And we also [especially] thank God continually for this, that when you received the message of God [which you heard] from us, you welcomed it not as the word of [mere] men, but as it truly is, the Word of God, which is effectually at work in you who believe [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-29582c" title=" c">c</a>]</sup>exercising its superhuman power in those who adhere to and trust in and rely on it].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29583" class="sup">14</span>For you, brethren, became imitators of the assemblies (churches) of God in Christ Jesus which are in Judea, for you too have suffered the same kind of treatment from your own fellow countrymen as they did [who were persecuted at the hands] of the Jews,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29584" class="sup">15</span>Who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and harassed and drove us out, and continue to make themselves hateful and offensive to God and to show themselves foes of all men,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29585" class="sup">16</span>Forbidding and hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles (the nations) that they may be saved. So as always they fill up [to the brim the measure of] their sins. But God's wrath has come upon them at last [completely and forever]!<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-29585A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-29586" class="sup">17</span>But since we were bereft of you, brethren, for a little while in person, [of course] not in heart, we endeavored the more eagerly and with great longing to see you face to face,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29587" class="sup">18</span>Because it was our will to come to you. [I mean that] I, Paul, again and again [wanted to come], but Satan hindered and impeded us.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29588" class="sup">19</span>For what is our hope or happiness or our victor's wreath of exultant triumph when we stand in the presence of our Lord Jesus at His coming? Is it not you?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29589" class="sup">20</span>For you are [indeed] our glory and our joy!<p /> </p><p /><strong><br /><hr /><br /></strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-AMP-29573a"><a href="#en-AMP-29573" title="Go to 1 Thessalonians 2:4">1 Thessalonians 2:4</a> G.

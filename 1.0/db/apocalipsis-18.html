<p><h2>Revelation 18</h2><span id="en-AMP-30994" class="sup">1</span>THEN I saw another angel descending from heaven, possessing great authority, and the earth was illuminated with his radiance and splendor.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30995" class="sup">2</span>And he shouted with a mighty voice, She is fallen! Mighty Babylon is fallen! She has become a resort and dwelling place for demons, a dungeon haunted by every loathsome spirit, an abode for every filthy and detestable bird.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30996" class="sup">3</span>For all nations have drunk the wine of her passionate unchastity, and the rulers and leaders of the earth have joined with her in committing fornication (idolatry), and the businessmen of the earth have become rich with the wealth of her excessive luxury and wantonness.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30996A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30997" class="sup">4</span>I then heard another voice from heaven saying, Come out from her, my people, so that you may not share in her sins, neither participate in her plagues.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30997B" title="See cross-reference B">B</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30998" class="sup">5</span>For her iniquities (her crimes and transgressions) are piled up as high as heaven, and God has remembered her wickedness and [her] crimes [and calls them up for settlement].<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30998C" title="See cross-reference C">C</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30999" class="sup">6</span>Repay to her what she herself has paid [to others] and double [her doom] in accordance with what she has done.

Since in her heart she boasts, I am not a widow; as a queen [on a throne] I sit, and I shall never see suffering or experience sorrow--<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-31000E" title="See cross-reference E">E</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-31001" class="sup">8</span>So shall her plagues (afflictions, calamities) come thick upon her in a single day, pestilence and anguish and sorrow and famine; and she shall be utterly consumed (burned up with fire), for mighty is the Lord God Who judges her.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-31002" class="sup">9</span>And the rulers and leaders of the earth who joined her in her immorality (idolatry) and luxuriated with her will weep and beat their breasts and lament over her when they see the smoke of her conflagration.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-31002F" title="See cross-reference F">F</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-31003" class="sup">10</span>They will stand a long way off, in terror of her torment, and they will cry, Woe and alas, the great city, the mighty city, Babylon! In one single hour how your doom (judgment) has overtaken you!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-31004" class="sup">11</span>And earth's businessmen will weep and grieve over her because no one buys their freight (cargo) any more.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-31004G" title="See cross-reference G">G</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-31005" class="sup">12</span>Their merchandise is of gold, silver, precious stones, and pearls; of fine linen, purple, silk, and scarlet [stuffs]; all kinds of scented wood, all sorts of articles of ivory, all varieties of objects of costly woods, bronze, iron, and marble;<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-31005H" title="See cross-reference H">H</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-31006" class="sup">13</span>Of cinnamon, spices, incense, ointment and perfume, and frankincense, of wine and olive oil, fine flour and wheat; of cattle and sheep, horses and conveyances; and of slaves (the bodies) and souls of men!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-31007" class="sup">14</span>The ripe fruits and delicacies for which your soul longed have gone from you, and all your luxuries and dainties, your elegance and splendor are lost to you, never again to be recovered or experienced!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-31008" class="sup">15</span>The dealers who handled these articles, who grew wealthy through their business with her, will stand a long way off, in terror of her doom and torment, weeping and grieving aloud, and saying,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-31009" class="sup">16</span>Alas, alas for the great city that was robed in fine linen, in purple and scarlet, bedecked and glittering with gold, with precious stones, and with pearls!<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-31009I" title="See cross-reference I">I</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-31010" class="sup">17</span>Because in one [single] hour all the vast wealth has been destroyed (wiped out).

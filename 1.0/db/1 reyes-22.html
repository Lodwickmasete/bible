<p><h2>1 Kings 22</h2><span id="en-AMP-9482" class="sup">1</span>SYRIA AND Israel continued without war for three years.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9483" class="sup">2</span>In the third year Jehoshaphat king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9484" class="sup">3</span>And [Ahab] king of Israel said to his servants, Do you know that Ramoth in Gilead is ours, and we keep silence and do not take it from the king of Syria?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9485" class="sup">4</span>And [Ahab] said to Jehoshaphat, Will you go with me to Ramoth-gilead to battle? Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9486" class="sup">5</span>But Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Inquire first, I pray you, for the word of the Lord today.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9487" class="sup">6</span>Then [Ahab] king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about 400 men, and said to them, Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I hold back? And they said, Go up, for the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9488" class="sup">7</span>Jehoshaphat said, Is there not another prophet of the Lord here whom we may ask?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9489" class="sup">8</span>[Ahab] king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, Micaiah son of Imlah, by whom we may inquire of the Lord, but I hate him, for he never prophesies good for me, but evil. Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say that.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9490" class="sup">9</span>Then [Ahab] king of Israel told an officer, Bring quickly Micaiah son of Imlah.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9491" class="sup">10</span>Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah were sitting in [royal] robes [or armor], each on his throne in an open place [on a threshing floor] at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9492" class="sup">11</span>And Zedekiah son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron and said, Thus says the Lord: With these you shall push the Syrians until they are destroyed.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9493" class="sup">12</span>And all the prophets agreed, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead and prosper, for the Lord will deliver it into the king's hand.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9494" class="sup">13</span>The messenger who went to call Micaiah said to him, Behold now, the prophets unanimously declare good to the king. Let your answer, I pray you, be like theirs, and say what is good.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9495" class="sup">14</span>But Micaiah said, As the Lord lives, I will speak what the Lord says to me.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9496" class="sup">15</span>So he came to the king. King [Ahab] said, Micaiah, shall we go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we hold back? And he answered, Go and prosper, for the Lord will deliver it into the king's hand.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9497" class="sup">16</span>And the king said to him, How many times must I charge you to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the Lord?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9498" class="sup">17</span>And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills as sheep that have no shepherd, and the Lord said, These have no master. Let them return every man to his house in peace.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9499" class="sup">18</span>Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell you that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9500" class="sup">19</span>And Micaiah said, Hear the word of the Lord: I saw the Lord sitting on His throne, and all the host of heaven standing by Him on His right hand and on His left.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9501" class="sup">20</span>And the Lord said, Who will entice Ahab to go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? One said this way, another said that way.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9502" class="sup">21</span>Then there came forth a spirit [of whom I am about to tell] and stood before the Lord and said, I will entice him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9503" class="sup">22</span>The Lord said to him, By what means? And he said, I will go forth and be a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets. [The Lord] said, You shall entice him and succeed also. Go forth and do it.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9504" class="sup">23</span>So the Lord has put a lying spirit in the mouths of all these prophets; and the Lord has spoken evil concerning you.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9505" class="sup">24</span>But Zedekiah son of Chenaanah went near and struck Micaiah on the cheek and said, Which way went the Spirit of the Lord from me to speak to you?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9506" class="sup">25</span>Micaiah said, Behold, you shall see on that day when you go into an inner chamber to hide yourself.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9507" class="sup">26</span>[Ahab] king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, carry him back to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king's son,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9508" class="sup">27</span>And say, The king says, Put this fellow in prison and feed him with bread and water of affliction until I come in peace.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9509" class="sup">28</span>Micaiah said, If you return at all in peace, the Lord has not spoken by me. He [added], Hear, O people, every one of you!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9510" class="sup">29</span>So [Ahab] king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9511" class="sup">30</span>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself and enter the battle, but you put on your [royal] clothing. And the king of Israel disguised himself and went into the battle.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9512" class="sup">31</span>But the king of Syria had commanded the thirty-two captains of his chariots, Fight neither with small nor great, but only with [Ahab] king of Israel.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9513" class="sup">32</span>And when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said, Surely it is the king of Israel. They turned to fight against him, but Jehoshaphat cried out.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9514" class="sup">33</span>And when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9515" class="sup">34</span>But a certain man drew a bow at a venture and smote [Ahab] the king of Israel between the joints of the armor. So he said to the driver of his chariot, Turn around and carry me out of the army, for I am wounded.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9516" class="sup">35</span>The battle increased that day, and [Ahab] the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Syrians, and at nightfall he died. And the blood of his wound flowed onto the floor of the chariot.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9517" class="sup">36</span>And there went a cry throughout the army about sundown, saying, Every man to his city and his own country,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9518" class="sup">37</span>For the king is dead! And [Ahab] was brought to Samaria, where they buried him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9519" class="sup">38</span>And they washed [his] chariot by the pool of Samaria, where the harlots bathed, and the dogs licked up his blood, as the Lord had predicted.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-9519A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-9520" class="sup">39</span>The rest of Ahab's acts, all he did, the ivory palace and all the cities he built, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9521" class="sup">40</span>So Ahab slept with his fathers. Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9522" class="sup">41</span>Jehoshaphat son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9523" class="sup">42</span>Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother was Azubah daughter of Shilhi.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9524" class="sup">43</span>He walked in all the ways or customs of Asa his father, never swerving from it, doing right in the sight of the Lord. However, the [idolatrous] high places were not taken away; for the people still sacrificed and burned incense in the high places.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9525" class="sup">44</span>And Jehoshaphat made peace with Israel's king.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9526" class="sup">45</span>The rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, his might that he showed and how he warred, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9527" class="sup">46</span>And the remnant of the sodomites (the male cult prostitutes) who remained in the days of his father Asa, [Jehoshaphat] expelled from the country.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9528" class="sup">47</span>There was no king in Edom; a deputy was acting king.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9529" class="sup">48</span>Jehoshaphat ordered ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold, but they did not go, for the ships were wrecked at Ezion-geber.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9530" class="sup">49</span>When Ahaziah son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with your servants in the ships, Jehoshaphat refused.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9531" class="sup">50</span>Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with them in the city of David his father [forefather].

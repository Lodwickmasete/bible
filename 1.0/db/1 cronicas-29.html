<p><h2>1 Chronicles 29</h2><span id="en-AMP-11166" class="sup">1</span>AND KING David said to all the assembly, Solomon my son, whom alone God has chosen, is yet young, tender, and inexperienced; and the work is great, for the palace is not to be for man but for the Lord God.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11167" class="sup">2</span>So I have provided with all my might for the house of my God the gold for things to be of gold, silver for things of silver, bronze for things of bronze, iron for things of iron, and wood for things of wood, as well as onyx or beryl stones, stones to be set, stones of antimony, stones of various colors, and all sorts of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11168" class="sup">3</span>Moreover, because I have set my affection on the house of my God, in addition to all I have prepared for the holy house, I have a private treasure of gold and silver which I give for the house of my God:<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11169" class="sup">4</span>It is 3,000 talents of gold, gold of Ophir, 7,000 talents of refined silver for overlaying the walls of the house,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11170" class="sup">5</span>Gold for the uses of gold, silver for the uses of silver, and for every work to be done by craftsmen. Now who will offer willingly to fill his hand [and consecrate it] today to the Lord [like one consecrating himself to the priesthood]?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11171" class="sup">6</span>Then the chiefs of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers of the king's work, offered willingly<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11172" class="sup">7</span>And gave for the service of the house of God--of gold 5,000 talents and 10,000 darics, of silver 10,000 talents, of bronze 18,000 talents, and 100,000 talents of iron.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11173" class="sup">8</span>And whoever had precious stones gave them to the treasury of the house of the Lord in the care of Jehiel the Gershonite.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11174" class="sup">9</span>Then the people rejoiced because these had given willingly, for with a whole and blameless heart they had offered freely to the Lord. King David also rejoiced greatly.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11175" class="sup">10</span>Therefore David blessed the Lord before all the assembly and said, Be praised, adored, and thanked, O Lord, the God of Israel our [forefather], forever and ever.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11176" class="sup">11</span>Yours, O Lord, is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty, for all that is in the heavens and the earth is Yours; Yours is the kingdom, O Lord, and Yours it is to be exalted as Head over all.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11177" class="sup">12</span>Both riches and honor come from You, and You reign over all. In Your hands are power and might; in Your hands it is to make great and to give strength to all.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11178" class="sup">13</span>Now therefore, our God, we thank You and praise Your glorious name and those attributes which that name denotes.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11179" class="sup">14</span>But who am I, and what are my people, that we should retain strength and be able to offer thus so willingly? For all things come from You, and out of Your own [hand] we have given You.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11180" class="sup">15</span>For we are strangers before You, and sojourners, as all our fathers were; our days on the earth are like a shadow, and there is no hope or expectation of remaining.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11181" class="sup">16</span>O Lord our God, all this store that we have prepared to build You a house for Your holy Name and the token of Your presence comes from Your hand, and is all Your own.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11182" class="sup">17</span>I know also, my God, that You try the heart and delight in uprightness. In the uprightness of my heart I have freely offered all these things. And now I have seen with joy Your people who are present here offer voluntarily and freely to You.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11183" class="sup">18</span>O Lord, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our fathers, keep forever such purposes and thoughts in the minds of Your people, and direct and establish their hearts toward You.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11184" class="sup">19</span>And give to Solomon my son a blameless heart to keep Your commandments, testimonies, and statutes, and to do all that is necessary to build the palace [for You] for which I have made provision.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11185" class="sup">20</span>And David said to all the assembly, Now adore (praise and thank) the Lord your God! And all the assembly blessed the Lord, the God of their fathers, and bowed down and did obeisance to the Lord and to the king [as His earthly representative].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11186" class="sup">21</span>The next day they offered sacrifices and burnt offerings to the Lord: 1,000 bulls, 1,000 rams, and 1,000 lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11187" class="sup">22</span>They ate and drank before the Lord on that day with great rejoicing. They made Solomon son of David king a second time, and anointed him as prince for the Lord and Zadok to be high priest.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11188" class="sup">23</span>Then Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord as king instead of David his father; and he prospered, and all Israel obeyed him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11189" class="sup">24</span>All the leaders and mighty men, and also all the sons of King David, pledged allegiance to King Solomon.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11190" class="sup">25</span>And the Lord magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11191" class="sup">26</span>Thus David son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11192" class="sup">27</span>The time he reigned over Israel was forty years--he reigned seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11193" class="sup">28</span>He died in a good old age [his seventy-first year], full and satisfied with days, riches, and honor. Solomon his son reigned in his stead.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11194" class="sup">29</span>Now the acts of King David, from first to last, are written in the recorded words of Samuel the seer, Nathan the prophet, and Gad the seer,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11195" class="sup">30</span>With accounts of all his reign and his might, and the times through which he and Israel passed, as did all the kingdoms of the countries. </p><p /><br /></div>

<p><h2>2 Corinthians 8</h2><span id="en-AMP-28932" class="sup">1</span>WE WANT to tell you further, brethren, about the grace (the favor and spiritual blessing) of God which has been evident in the churches of Macedonia [arousing in them the desire to give alms];<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28933" class="sup">2</span>For in the midst of an ordeal of severe tribulation, their abundance of joy and their depth of poverty [together] have overflowed in wealth of lavish generosity on their part.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28934" class="sup">3</span>For, as I can bear witness, [they gave] according to their ability, yes, and beyond their ability; and [they did it] voluntarily,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28935" class="sup">4</span>Begging us most insistently for the favor and the fellowship of contributing in this ministration for [the relief and support of] the saints [in Jerusalem].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28936" class="sup">5</span>Nor [was this gift of theirs merely the contribution] that we expected, but first they gave themselves to the Lord and to us [as His agents] by the will of God [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28936a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>entirely disregarding their personal interests, they gave as much as they possibly could, having put themselves at our disposal to be directed by the will of God]--<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28937" class="sup">6</span>So much so that we have urged Titus that as he began it, he should also complete this beneficent and gracious contribution among you [the church at Corinth].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28938" class="sup">7</span>Now as you abound and excel and are at the front in everything--in faith, in expressing yourselves, in knowledge, in all zeal, and in your love for us--[see to it that you come to the front now and] abound and excel in this gracious work [of almsgiving] also.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28939" class="sup">8</span>I give this not as an order [to dictate to you], but to prove, by [pointing out] the zeal of others, the sincerity of your [own] love also.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28940" class="sup">9</span>For you are becoming progressively acquainted with and recognizing more strongly and clearly the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ (His kindness, His gracious generosity, His undeserved favor and spiritual blessing), [in] that though He was [so very] rich, yet for your sakes He became [so very] poor, in order that by His poverty you might become enriched (abundantly supplied).<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28941" class="sup">10</span>[It is then] my counsel and my opinion in this matter that I give [you when I say]: It is profitable and fitting for you [now to complete the enterprise] which more than a year ago you not only began, but were the first to wish to do anything [about contributions for the relief of the saints at Jerusalem].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28942" class="sup">11</span>So now finish doing it, that your [enthusiastic] readiness in desiring it may be equalled by your completion of it according to your ability and means.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28943" class="sup">12</span>For if the [eager] readiness to give is there, then it is acceptable and welcomed in proportion to what a person has, not according to what he does not have.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28944" class="sup">13</span>For it is not [intended] that other people be eased and relieved [of their responsibility] and you be burdened and suffer [unfairly],<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28945" class="sup">14</span>But to have equality [share and share alike], your surplus over necessity at the present time going to meet their want and to equalize the difference created by it, so that [at some other time] their surplus in turn may be given to supply your want. Thus there may be equality,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28946" class="sup">15</span>As it is written, He who gathered much had nothing over, and he who gathered little did not lack.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-28946A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-28947" class="sup">16</span>But thanks be to God Who planted the same earnest zeal and care for you in the heart of Titus.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28948" class="sup">17</span>For he not only welcomed and responded to our appeal, but was himself so keen in his enthusiasm and interest in you that he is going to you of his own accord.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28949" class="sup">18</span>But we are sending along with him that brother [Luke?] whose praise in the Gospel ministry [is spread] throughout all the churches;<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28950" class="sup">19</span>And more than that, he has been appointed by the churches to travel as our companion in regard to this bountiful contribution which we are administering for the glory of the Lord Himself and [to show] our eager readiness [as Christians to help one another].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28951" class="sup">20</span>[For] we are on our guard, intending that no one should find anything for which to blame us in regard to our administration of this large contribution.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28952" class="sup">21</span>For we take thought beforehand and aim to be honest and absolutely above suspicion, not only in the sight of the Lord but also in the sight of men.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28953" class="sup">22</span>Moreover, along with them we are sending our brother, whom we have often put to the test and have found him zealous (devoted and earnest) in many matters, but who is now more [eagerly] earnest than ever because of [his] absolute confidence in you.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28954" class="sup">23</span>As for Titus, he is my colleague and shares my work in your service; and as for the [other two] brethren, they are the [special] messengers of the churches, a credit and glory to Christ (the Messiah).<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28955" class="sup">24</span>Show to these men, therefore, in the sight of the churches, the reality and plain truth of your love (your affection, goodwill, and benevolence) and what [good reasons] I had for boasting about and being proud of you.<p /> </p><p /><strong><br /><hr /><br /></strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-AMP-28936a"><a href="#en-AMP-28936" title="Go to 2 Corinthians 8:5">2 Corinthians 8:5</a> Joseph Thayer, A Greek-English Lexicon.</li>

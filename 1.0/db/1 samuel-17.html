<p><h2>1 Samuel 17</h2><span id="en-AMP-7620" class="sup">1</span>NOW THE Philistines gathered their armies for battle and were assembled at Socoh, which belongs to Judah, and encamped between Socoh and Azekah in Ephes-dammim.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7621" class="sup">2</span>Saul and the men of Israel were encamped in the Valley of Elah and drew up in battle array against the Philistines.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7622" class="sup">3</span>And the Philistines stood on a mountain on one side and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side, with the valley between them.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7623" class="sup">4</span>And a champion went out of the camp of the Philistines named Goliath of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span [almost ten feet].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7624" class="sup">5</span>And he had a bronze helmet on his head and wore a coat of mail, and the coat weighed 5,000 shekels of bronze.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7625" class="sup">6</span>He had bronze shin armor on his legs and a bronze javelin across his shoulders.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7626" class="sup">7</span>And the shaft of his spear was like a weaver's beam; his spear's head weighed 600 shekels of iron. And a shield bearer went before him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7627" class="sup">8</span>Goliath stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel, Why have you come out to draw up for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and are you not servants of Saul? Choose a man for yourselves and let him come down to me.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7628" class="sup">9</span>If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then we will be your servants; but if I prevail against him and kill him, then you shall be our servants and serve us.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7629" class="sup">10</span>And the Philistine said, I defy the ranks of Israel this day; give me a man, that we may fight together.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7630" class="sup">11</span>When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7631" class="sup">12</span>David was the son of an Ephrathite of Bethlehem in Judah named Jesse, who had eight sons. [Jesse] in the days of Saul was old, advanced in years.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7632" class="sup">13</span>[His] three eldest sons had followed Saul into battle. Their names were Eliab the firstborn; next, Abinadab; and third, Shammah.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7633" class="sup">14</span>David was the youngest. The three eldest followed Saul,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7634" class="sup">15</span>But David went back and forth from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7635" class="sup">16</span>The Philistine came out morning and evening, presenting himself for forty days.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7636" class="sup">17</span>And Jesse said to David his son, Take for your brothers an ephah of this parched grain and these ten loaves and carry them quickly to your brothers at the camp.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7637" class="sup">18</span>Also take these ten cheeses to the commander of their thousand. See how your brothers fare and bring some token from them.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7638" class="sup">19</span>Now Saul and the brothers and all the men of Israel were in the Valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7639" class="sup">20</span>So David rose up early next morning, left the sheep with a keeper, took the provisions, and went, as Jesse had commanded him. And he came to the encampment as the host going forth to the battleground shouted the battle cry.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7640" class="sup">21</span>And Israel and the Philistines put the battle in array, army against army.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7641" class="sup">22</span>David left his packages in the care of the baggage keeper and ran into the ranks and came and greeted his brothers.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7642" class="sup">23</span>As they talked, behold, Goliath, the champion, the Philistine of Gath, came forth from the Philistine ranks and spoke the same words as before, and David heard him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7643" class="sup">24</span>And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him, terrified.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7644" class="sup">25</span>And the Israelites said, Have you seen this man who has come out? Surely he has come out to defy Israel; and the man who kills him the king will enrich with great riches, and will give him his daughter and make his father's house free [from taxes and service] in Israel.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7645" class="sup">26</span>And David said to the men standing by him, What shall be done for the man who kills this Philistine and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7646" class="sup">27</span>And the [men] told him, Thus shall it be done for the man who kills him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7647" class="sup">28</span>Now Eliab his eldest brother heard what he said to the men; and Eliab's anger was kindled against David and he said, Why did you come here? With whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your presumption and evilness of heart; for you came down that you might see the battle.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7648" class="sup">29</span>And David said, What have I done now? Was it not a harmless question?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7649" class="sup">30</span>And David turned away from Eliab to another and he asked the same question, and again the men gave him the same answer.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7650" class="sup">31</span>When David's words were heard, they were repeated to Saul, and he sent for him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7651" class="sup">32</span>David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of this Philistine; your servant will go out and fight with him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7652" class="sup">33</span>And Saul said to David, You are not able to go to fight against this Philistine. You are only an adolescent, and he has been a warrior from his youth.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7653" class="sup">34</span>And David said to Saul, Your servant kept his father's sheep. And when there came a lion or again a bear and took a lamb out of the flock,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7654" class="sup">35</span>I went out after it and smote it and delivered the lamb out of its mouth; and when it arose against me, I caught it by its beard and smote it and killed it.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7655" class="sup">36</span>Your servant killed both the lion and the bear; and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be like one of them, for he has defied the armies of the living God!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7656" class="sup">37</span>David said, The Lord Who delivered me out of the paw of the lion and out of the paw of the bear, He will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said to David, Go, and the Lord be with you!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7657" class="sup">38</span>Then Saul clothed David with his armor; he put a bronze helmet on his head and clothed him with a coat of mail.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7658" class="sup">39</span>And David girded his sword over his armor. Then he tried to go, but could not, for he was not used to it. And David said to Saul, I cannot go with these, for I am not used to them. And David took them off.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7659" class="sup">40</span>Then he took his staff in his hand and chose five smooth stones out of the brook and put them in his shepherd's [lunch] bag [a whole kid's skin slung from his shoulder], in his pouch, and his sling was in his hand, and he drew near the Philistine.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7660" class="sup">41</span>The Philistine came on and drew near to David, the man who bore the shield going before him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7661" class="sup">42</span>And when the Philistine looked around and saw David, he scorned and despised him, for he was but an adolescent, with a healthy reddish color and a fair face.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7662" class="sup">43</span>And the Philistine said to David, Am I a dog, that you should come to me with sticks? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7663" class="sup">44</span>The Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7664" class="sup">45</span>Then said David to the Philistine, You come to me with a sword, a spear, and a javelin, but I come to you in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the ranks of Israel, Whom you have defied.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7665" class="sup">46</span>This day the Lord will deliver you into my hand, and I will smite you and cut off your head. And I will give the corpses of the army of the Philistines this day to the birds of the air and the wild beasts of the earth, that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7666" class="sup">47</span>And all this assembly shall know that the Lord saves not with sword and spear; for the battle is the Lord's, and He will give you into our hands.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7667" class="sup">48</span>When the Philistine came forward to meet David, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet the Philistine.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7668" class="sup">49</span>David put his hand into his bag and took out a stone and slung it, and it struck the Philistine, sinking into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the earth.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7669" class="sup">50</span>So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and struck down the Philistine and slew him. But no sword was in David's hand.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7670" class="sup">51</span>So he ran and stood over the Philistine, took his sword and drew it out of its sheath, and killed him, and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw that their mighty champion was dead, they fled.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7671" class="sup">52</span>And the men of Israel and Judah rose with a shout and pursued the Philistines as far as Gath and the gates of Ekron. So the wounded Philistines fell along the way from Shaaraim as far as Gath and Ekron.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7672" class="sup">53</span>The Israelites returned from their pursuit of the Philistines and plundered their tents.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7673" class="sup">54</span>David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem, but he put his armor in his tent.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7674" class="sup">55</span>When Saul saw David go out against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As your soul lives, O king, I cannot tell.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7675" class="sup">56</span>And the king said, Inquire whose son the stripling is.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7676" class="sup">57</span>When David returned from killing Goliath the Philistine, Abner brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7677" class="sup">58</span>And Saul said to him, Whose son are you, young man? And David answered, I am the son of your servant Jesse of Bethlehem.<p /> </p><p /><br /></div>

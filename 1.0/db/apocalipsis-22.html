<p><h2>Revelation 22</h2><span id="en-AMP-31081" class="sup">1</span>THEN HE showed me the river whose waters give life, sparkling like crystal, flowing out from the throne of God and of the Lamb<p />  <span id="en-AMP-31082" class="sup">2</span>Through the middle of the broadway of the city; also, on either side of the river was the tree of life with its twelve varieties of fruit, yielding each month its fresh crop; and the leaves of the tree were for the healing and the restoration of the nations.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-31082A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-31083" class="sup">3</span>There shall no longer exist there anything that is accursed (detestable, foul, offensive, impure, hateful, or horrible). But the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and His servants shall worship Him [pay divine honors to Him and do Him holy service].<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-31083B" title="See cross-reference B">B</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-31084" class="sup">4</span>They shall see His face, and His name shall be on their foreheads.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-31084C" title="See cross-reference C">C</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-31085" class="sup">5</span>And there shall be no more night; they have no need for lamplight or sunlight, for the Lord God will illuminate them and be their light, and they shall reign [as kings] forever and ever (through the eternities of the eternities).<p />  <span id="en-AMP-31086" class="sup">6</span>And he [of the seven angels further] said to me, These statements are reliable (worthy of confidence) and genuine (true). And the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent His messenger (angel) to make known and exhibit to His servants what must soon come to pass.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-31087" class="sup">7</span>And behold, I am coming speedily. Blessed (happy and <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-31087a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>to be envied) is he who observes and lays to heart and keeps the truths of the prophecy (the predictions, consolations, and warnings) contained in this [little] book.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-31088" class="sup">8</span>And I, John, am he who heard and witnessed these things. And when I heard and saw them, I fell prostrate before the feet of the messenger (angel) who showed them to me, to worship him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-31089" class="sup">9</span>But he said to me, Refrain! [You must not do that!] I am [only] a fellow servant along with yourself and with your brethren the prophets and with those who are mindful of and practice [the truths contained in] the messages of this book. Worship God!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-31090" class="sup">10</span>And he [further] told me, Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book and make no secret of them, for the time <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-31090b" title=" b">b</a>]</sup>when things are brought to a crisis and the period of their fulfillment is near.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-31091" class="sup">11</span>He who is unrighteous (unjust, wicked), let him be unrighteous still; and he who is filthy (vile, impure), let him be filthy still; and he who is righteous (just, upright, in right standing with God), let him do right still; and he who is holy, let him be holy still.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-31091D" title="See cross-reference D">D</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-31092" class="sup">12</span>Behold, I am coming soon, and I shall bring My wages and rewards with Me, to repay and render to each one just what his own actions and his own work merit.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-31092E" title="See cross-reference E">E</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-31093" class="sup">13</span>I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last (the Before all and the End of all).<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-31093F" title="See cross-reference F">F</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-31094" class="sup">14</span>Blessed (happy and <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-31094c" title=" c">c</a>]</sup>to be envied) are those who cleanse their garments, that they may have the authority and right to [approach] the tree of life and to enter through the gates into the city.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-31094G" title="See cross-reference G">G</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-31095" class="sup">15</span>[But] without are the dogs and those who practice sorceries (magic arts) and impurity [the lewd, adulterers] and the murderers and idolaters and everyone who loves and deals in falsehood (untruth, error, deception, cheating).<p />  <span id="en-AMP-31096" class="sup">16</span>I, Jesus, have sent My messenger (angel) to you to witness and to give you assurance of these things for the churches (assemblies).

<p><h2>1 Samuel 1</h2><span id="en-AMP-7214" class="sup">1</span>THERE WAS a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of the hill country of Ephraim, named Elkanah son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7215" class="sup">2</span>He had two wives, one named Hannah and the other named Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7216" class="sup">3</span>This man went from his city year by year to worship and sacrifice to the Lord of hosts at Shiloh, where Hophni and Phinehas, the two sons of Eli, were the Lord's priests.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7217" class="sup">4</span>When the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he would give to Peninnah his wife and all her sons and daughters portions [of the sacrificial meat].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7218" class="sup">5</span>But to Hannah he gave a double portion, for he loved Hannah, but the Lord had given her no children.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7219" class="sup">6</span>[This embarrassed and grieved Hannah] and her rival provoked her greatly to vex her, because the Lord had left her childless.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7220" class="sup">7</span>So it was year after year; whenever Hannah went up to the Lord's house, Peninnah provoked her, so she wept and did not eat.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7221" class="sup">8</span>Then Elkanah her husband said to her, Hannah, why do you cry? And why do you not eat? And why are you grieving? Am I not more to you than ten sons?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7222" class="sup">9</span>So Hannah rose after they had eaten and drunk in Shiloh. Now Eli the priest was sitting on his seat beside a post of the temple (tent) of the Lord.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7223" class="sup">10</span>And [Hannah] was in distress of soul, praying to the Lord and weeping bitterly.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7224" class="sup">11</span>She vowed, saying, O Lord of hosts, if You will indeed look on the affliction of Your handmaid and [earnestly] remember, and not forget Your handmaid but will give me a son, I will give him to the Lord all his life; no razor shall touch his head.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7225" class="sup">12</span>And as she continued praying before the Lord, Eli noticed her mouth.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7226" class="sup">13</span>Hannah was speaking in her heart; only her lips moved but her voice was not heard. So Eli thought she was drunk.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7227" class="sup">14</span>Eli said to her, How long will you be intoxicated? Put wine away from you.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7228" class="sup">15</span>But Hannah answered, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I was pouring out my soul before the Lord.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-7228A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-7229" class="sup">16</span>Regard not your handmaid as a wicked woman; for out of my great complaint and bitter provocation I have been speaking.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7230" class="sup">17</span>Then Eli said, Go in peace, and may the God of Israel grant your petition which you have asked of Him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7231" class="sup">18</span>Hannah said, Let your handmaid find grace in your sight. So [she] went her way and ate, her countenance no longer sad.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7232" class="sup">19</span>The family rose early the next morning, worshiped before the Lord, and returned to their home in Ramah. Elkanah knew Hannah his wife, and the Lord remembered her.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7233" class="sup">20</span>Hannah became pregnant and in due time bore a son and named him Samuel [heard of God], Because, she said, I have asked him of the Lord.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7234" class="sup">21</span>And Elkanah and all his house went up to offer to the Lord the yearly sacrifice and pay his vow.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7235" class="sup">22</span>But Hannah did not go, for she said to her husband, I will not go until the child is weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before the Lord and remain there as long as he lives.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7236" class="sup">23</span>Elkanah her husband said to her, Do what seems best to you. Wait until you have weaned him; only may the Lord establish His word. So Hannah remained and nursed her son until she weaned him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7237" class="sup">24</span>When she had <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-7237a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>weaned him, she took him with her, with a three-year-old bull, an ephah of flour, and a skin bottle of wine [to pour over the burnt offering for a sweet odor], and brought Samuel to the Lord's house in Shiloh. The child was growing.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7238" class="sup">25</span>Then they slew the bull, and brought the child to Eli.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7239" class="sup">26</span>Hannah said, Oh, my lord! As your soul lives, my lord, I am the woman who stood by you here praying to the Lord.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7240" class="sup">27</span>For this child I prayed, and the Lord has granted my petition made to Him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7241" class="sup">28</span>Therefore I have given him to the Lord; as long as he lives he is given to the Lord. And they worshiped the Lord there.<p /> </p><p /><strong><br /><hr /><br /></strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-AMP-7237a"><a href="#en-AMP-7237" title="Go to 1 Samuel 1:24">1 Samuel 1:24</a> He would then be two or three years old.

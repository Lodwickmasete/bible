<p><h2>1 Thessalonians 1</h2><span id="en-AMP-29560" class="sup">1</span>PAUL, SILVANUS (Silas), and Timothy, to the assembly (church) of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah): Grace (spiritual blessing and divine favor) to you and [heart] peace.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29561" class="sup">2</span>We are ever giving thanks to God for all of you, continually mentioning [you when engaged] in our prayers,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29562" class="sup">3</span>Recalling unceasingly before our God and Father your work energized by faith and service motivated by love and unwavering hope in [the return of] our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah). [I Thess. 1:10.]<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29563" class="sup">4</span>[O] brethren beloved by God, we recognize and know that He has selected (chosen) you;<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29564" class="sup">5</span>For our [preaching of the] glad tidings (the Gospel) came to you not only in word, but also in [its own inherent] power and in the Holy Spirit and with great conviction and absolute certainty [on our part]. You know what kind of men we proved [ourselves] to be among you for your good.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29565" class="sup">6</span>And you [set yourselves to] become imitators of us and [through us] of the Lord Himself, for you welcomed our message in [spite of] much persecution, with joy [inspired] by the Holy Spirit;<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29566" class="sup">7</span>So that you [thus] became a pattern to all the believers (those who adhere to, trust in, and rely on Christ Jesus) in Macedonia and Achaia (most of Greece).<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29567" class="sup">8</span>For not only has the Word concerning and from the Lord resounded forth from you unmistakably in Macedonia and Achaia, but everywhere the report has gone forth of your faith in God [of your <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-29567a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>leaning of your whole personality on Him in complete trust and confidence in His power, wisdom, and goodness]. So we [find that we] never need to tell people anything [further about it].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29568" class="sup">9</span>For they themselves volunteer testimony concerning us, telling what an entrance we had among you, and how you turned to God from [your] idols to serve a God Who is alive and true and genuine,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29569" class="sup">10</span>And [how you] look forward to and await the coming of His Son from heaven, Whom He raised from the dead--Jesus, Who personally rescues and delivers us out of and from the wrath [bringing punishment] which is coming [upon the impenitent] and <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-29569b" title=" b">b</a>]</sup>draws us to Himself [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-29569c" title=" c">c</a>]</sup>investing us with all the privileges and rewards of the new life in Christ, the Messiah].<p /> </p><p /><strong><br /><hr /><br /></strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-AMP-29567a"><a href="#en-AMP-29567" title="Go to 1 Thessalonians 1:8">1 Thessalonians 1:8</a> Alexander Souter, Pocket Lexicon of the Greek New Testament.</li>

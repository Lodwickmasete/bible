<p><h2>1 Corinthians 4</h2><span id="en-AMP-28433" class="sup">1</span>SO THEN, let us [apostles] be looked upon as ministering servants of Christ and stewards (trustees) of the mysteries (the secret purposes) of God.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28434" class="sup">2</span>Moreover, it is [essentially] required of stewards that a man should be found faithful [proving himself worthy of trust].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28435" class="sup">3</span>But [as for me personally] it matters very little to me that I should be put on trial by you [on this point], and that you or any other human tribunal should investigate and question and cross-question me. I do not even put myself on trial and judge myself.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28436" class="sup">4</span>I am not conscious of anything against myself, and I feel blameless; but I am not vindicated and acquitted before God on that account. It is the Lord [Himself] Who examines and judges me.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28437" class="sup">5</span>So do not make any hasty or premature judgments before the time when the Lord comes [again], for He will both bring to light the secret things that are [now hidden] in darkness and disclose and expose the [secret] aims (motives and purposes) of hearts. Then every man will receive his [due] commendation from God.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28438" class="sup">6</span>Now I have applied all this [about parties and factions] to myself and Apollos for your sakes, brethren, so that from what I have said of us [as illustrations], you may learn [to think of men in accordance with Scripture and] not to go beyond that which is written, that none of you may be puffed up and inflated with pride and boast in favor of one [minister and teacher] against another.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28439" class="sup">7</span>For who separates you from the others [as a faction leader]? [Who makes you superior and sets you apart from another, giving you the preeminence?] What have you that was not given to you? If then you received it [from someone], why do you boast as if you had not received [but had gained it by your own efforts]?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28440" class="sup">8</span>[<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28440a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>You behave as if] you are already filled and think you have enough [you are full and content, feeling no need of anything more]! Already you have become rich [in spiritual gifts and graces]! [Without any counsel or instruction from us, in your conceit], you have ascended your thrones and come into your kingdom without including us! And would that it were true and that you did reign, so that we might be sharing the kingdom with you!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28441" class="sup">9</span>For it seems to me that God has made an exhibit of us apostles, exposing us to view last [of all, like men in a triumphal procession who are] sentenced to death [and displayed at the end of the line]. For we have become a spectacle to the world [a show in the world's amphitheater] with both men and angels [as spectators].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28442" class="sup">10</span>We are [looked upon as] fools on account of Christ and for His sake, but you are [supposedly] so amazingly wise and prudent in Christ! We are weak, but you are [so very] strong! You are highly esteemed, but we are in disrepute and contempt!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28443" class="sup">11</span>To this hour we have gone both hungry and thirsty; we [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28443b" title=" b">b</a>]</sup>habitually] wear but one undergarment [and shiver in the cold]; we are roughly knocked about and wander around homeless.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28444" class="sup">12</span>And we still toil unto weariness [for our living], working hard with our own hands. When men revile us [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28444c" title=" c">c</a>]</sup>wound us with an accursed sting], we bless them. When we are persecuted, we take it patiently and endure it.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28445" class="sup">13</span>When we are slandered and defamed, we [try to] answer softly and bring comfort. We have been made and are now the rubbish and filth of the world [the offscouring of all things, the scum of the earth].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28446" class="sup">14</span>I do not write this to shame you, but to warn and counsel you as my beloved children.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28447" class="sup">15</span>After all, though you should have ten thousand teachers (guides to direct you) in Christ, yet you do not have many fathers. For I became your father in Christ Jesus through the glad tidings (the Gospel).<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28448" class="sup">16</span>So I urge and implore you, be imitators of me.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28449" class="sup">17</span>For this very cause I sent to you Timothy, who is my beloved and trustworthy child in the Lord, who will recall to your minds my methods of proceeding and course of conduct and way of life in Christ, such as I teach everywhere in each of the churches.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28450" class="sup">18</span>Some of you have become conceited and arrogant and pretentious, counting on my not coming to you.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28451" class="sup">19</span>But I will come to you [and] shortly, if the Lord is willing, and then I will perceive and understand not what the talk of these puffed up and arrogant spirits amount to, but their force (<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28451d" title=" d">d</a>]</sup>the moral power and excellence of soul they really possess).<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28452" class="sup">20</span>For the kingdom of God consists of and is based on not talk but power (<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28452e" title=" e">e</a>]</sup>moral power and excellence of soul).<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28453" class="sup">21</span>Now which do you prefer? Shall I come to you with a rod of correction, or with love and in a spirit of gentleness?<p /> </p><p /><strong><br /><hr /><br /></strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-AMP-28440a"><a href="#en-AMP-28440" title="Go to 1 Corinthians 4:8">1 Corinthians 4:8</a> Henry Alford, The Greek New Testament, with Notes.</li>

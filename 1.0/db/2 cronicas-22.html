<p><h2>2 Chronicles 22</h2><span id="en-AMP-11646" class="sup">1</span>THE PEOPLE of Jerusalem made Ahaziah, his youngest son, king in his stead, for the troop that came with the Arabs to the camp had slain all the older sons. So Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11647" class="sup">2</span>Forty-two years old was Ahaziah when he began his one-year reign in Jerusalem. His mother was Athaliah, a granddaughter of Omri.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-11647A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-11648" class="sup">3</span>He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother was his counselor to do wickedly.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11649" class="sup">4</span>So he did evil in the sight of the Lord like the house of Ahab, for they were his counselors after his father's death, to his destruction.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11650" class="sup">5</span>He followed their counsel and even went with <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-11650a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>Joram son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria at Ramoth-gilead. And the Syrians wounded Joram;<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-11650B" title="See cross-reference B">B</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-11651" class="sup">6</span>And he returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds given him at Ramah when he fought against Hazael king of Syria. Azariah son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to see Joram son of Ahab in Jezreel because he was sick.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11652" class="sup">7</span>But the destruction of Ahaziah was ordained of God in his coming to visit Joram. For when he got there he went out with Joram against Jehu son of Nimshi, whom the Lord had anointed to destroy the house of Ahab.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11653" class="sup">8</span>And when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab, he met the princes of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah's slain brothers, who attended Ahaziah, and he slew them.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11654" class="sup">9</span>And [Jehu] sought Ahaziah, who was hiding in Samaria; he was captured, brought to Jehu, and slain. They buried him, for they said, After all, he is the grandson of Jehoshaphat, who sought the Lord with all his heart. So the house of Ahaziah had no one left able to rule the kingdom.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11655" class="sup">10</span>But when Athaliah mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal family of Judah.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11656" class="sup">11</span>But Jehosheba, the daughter of the king, took Joash [infant] son of Ahaziah and stole him away from among the king's sons who were to be slain, and she put him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So Jehosheba daughter of King Jehoram, sister of Ahaziah, and wife of Jehoiada the priest, hid [Joash] from [his grandmother] Athaliah, so that she did not slay him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11657" class="sup">12</span>And Joash was with them hidden in the house of God six years, and Athaliah reigned over the land.<p /> </p><p /><strong><br /><hr /><br /></strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-AMP-11650a"><a href="#en-AMP-11650" title="Go to 2 Chronicles 22:5">2 Chronicles 22:5</a>  on II Kings 1:17.</li>

<p><h2>1 Kings 9</h2><span id="en-AMP-9053" class="sup">1</span>WHEN SOLOMON finished the building of the Lord's house and the king's house, and all he desired and was pleased to do,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9054" class="sup">2</span>The Lord appeared to Solomon the second time, as He had appeared to him at Gibeon.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9055" class="sup">3</span>The Lord told him, I have heard your prayer and supplication which you have made before Me; I have hallowed this house which you have built, and I have put My Name [and My Presence] there forever. My eyes and My heart shall be there perpetually.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9056" class="sup">4</span>And if you will walk before Me, as David your father walked, in integrity of heart and uprightness, doing according to all that I have commanded you, keeping My statutes and My precepts,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9057" class="sup">5</span>Then I will establish your royal throne over Israel forever, as I promised David your father, saying, There shall not fail you [to have] a man upon the throne of Israel.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9058" class="sup">6</span>But if you turn away from following Me, you or your children, and will not keep My commandments and My statutes which I have set before you but go and serve other gods and worship them,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9059" class="sup">7</span>Then I will cut off Israel from the land I have given them, and this house I have hallowed for My Name (renown) I will cast from My sight. And Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all the peoples.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9060" class="sup">8</span>This house shall become a heap of ruins; every passerby shall be astonished and shall hiss [with surprise] and say, Why has the Lord done thus to this land and to this house?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9061" class="sup">9</span>Then they will answer, Because they forsook the Lord their God, Who brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have laid hold of other gods and have worshiped and served them; therefore the Lord has brought on them all this evil.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9062" class="sup">10</span>At the end of twenty years, in which Solomon had built the two houses, the Lord's house and the king's house,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9063" class="sup">11</span>For which Hiram king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with as much cedar and cypress timber and gold as he desired, King Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9064" class="sup">12</span>And Hiram came from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him, and they did not please him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9065" class="sup">13</span>He said, What are these cities worth which you have given me, my brother? So they are called the Cabul [unproductive] Land to this day.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9066" class="sup">14</span>And Hiram sent to the king 120 talents of gold.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9067" class="sup">15</span>This is the account of the levy [of forced labor] which King Solomon raised to build the house of the Lord, his own house, the Millo, the wall of Jerusalem, Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9068" class="sup">16</span>For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up and taken Gezer, burned it with fire, slew the Canaanites who dwelt in the city, and had given it as dowry to his daughter, Solomon's wife.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9069" class="sup">17</span>So Solomon rebuilt Gezer and Lower Beth-horon,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9070" class="sup">18</span>Baalath and Tamar (Tadmor) in the wilderness, in the land of Judah,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9071" class="sup">19</span>And all the store cities which Solomon had and cities for his chariots and cities for his horsemen, and whatever Solomon desired to build <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-9071a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>for his pleasure in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9072" class="sup">20</span>As for all the people who were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, who were not Israelites,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9073" class="sup">21</span>Their children who were left after them in the land, whom the Israelites were not able utterly to destroy, of them Solomon made a forced levy of slaves to this day.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9074" class="sup">22</span>But Solomon made no slaves of the Israelites; they were the soldiers, his officials, attendants, commanders, captains, chariot officers, and horsemen.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9075" class="sup">23</span>These were the chief officers over Solomon's work, 550 who had charge of the people who did the work.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9076" class="sup">24</span>But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the City of David to her house which Solomon had built for her; then he built the Millo.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9077" class="sup">25</span>Three times a year Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar he built to the Lord, and he burned incense with them before the Lord. So he finished the house.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9078" class="sup">26</span>And King Solomon made a fleet of ships in Ezion-geber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red Sea, in Edom.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9079" class="sup">27</span>And Hiram sent with the fleet his servants, shipmen who had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9080" class="sup">28</span>They came to Ophir and got 420 talents of gold and brought it to King Solomon.<p /> </p><p /><strong><br /><hr /><br /></strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-AMP-9071a"><a href="#en-AMP-9071" title="Go to 1 Kings 9:19">1 Kings 9:19</a> Once on the throne Solomon became a thoroughgoing despot. All political power was taken out of the hands of the tribal sheiks... and placed in the hands of officers who were simply puppets of Solomon. The resources of the nation were expended not on works of public utility but on the personal aggrandizement of the monarch. In the means he took to gratify his passions he showed himself to be little better than a savage (James Orr et al., eds., The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia). The division of the nation at Solomon's death with all the weakness and misery that it caused [idolatry, ignoring God, captivity, exile, the loss of the ten tribes] through the coming centuries was the direct outgrowth of Solomon's unholy self-indulgence (Amos R. Wells, Bible Miniatures). Because of his extensive building program and his extravagant expenditures in the maintenance of his luxurious court, he resorted to forced labor and heavy taxation. Bitter opposition to his rule thus engendered the division of the united kingdom after his death (The New Jewish Encyclopedia).</li>

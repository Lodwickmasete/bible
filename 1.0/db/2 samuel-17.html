<p><h2>2 Samuel 17</h2><span id="en-AMP-8451" class="sup">1</span>MOREOVER, AHITHOPHEL said to Absalom, Let me choose 12,000 men and I will set out and pursue David this night.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8452" class="sup">2</span>I will come upon him while he is exhausted and weak, and cause him to panic; all the people with him will flee. Then I will strike down the king alone.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8453" class="sup">3</span>I will bring back all the people to you. [The removal of] the man whom you seek is the assurance that all will return; and all the people will be at peace.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8454" class="sup">4</span>And what he said pleased Absalom well and all the elders of Israel.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8455" class="sup">5</span>Absalom said, Now call Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear what he says.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8456" class="sup">6</span>When Hushai came, Absalom said to him, Ahithophel has counseled thus. Shall we do what he says? If not, speak up.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8457" class="sup">7</span>And Hushai said to Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel has given is not good at this time.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8458" class="sup">8</span>For, said Hushai, you know your father and his men, that they are mighty men, and they are embittered and enraged like a bear robbed of her whelps in the field. And your father is a man of war, and will not lodge with the people.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8459" class="sup">9</span>Behold, he is hidden even now in some pit or other place; and when some of them are overthrown at the first, whoever hears it will say, There is a slaughter among the followers of Absalom.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8460" class="sup">10</span>And even he who is brave, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, will utterly melt, for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man and that those who are with him are brave men.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8461" class="sup">11</span>Therefore I counsel that all [the men of] Israel be gathered to you, from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude, and that you go to battle in your own person.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8462" class="sup">12</span>So shall we come upon [David] some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew settles [unseen and unheard] on the ground; and of him and of all the men with him there shall not be left so much as one.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8463" class="sup">13</span>If he withdraws into a city, then shall all Israel bring ropes to that city, and we will drag it into the ravine until not one pebble is left there.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8464" class="sup">14</span>Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than that of Ahithophel. For the Lord had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahithophel, so that the Lord might bring evil upon Absalom.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8465" class="sup">15</span>Then said Hushai to Zadok and Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counsel Absalom and the elders of Israel, and thus and thus have I counseled.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8466" class="sup">16</span>Now send quickly and tell David, Lodge not this night at the fords [at the Jordan] of the wilderness, but by all means pass over, lest the king be swallowed up and all the people with him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8467" class="sup">17</span>Now [the youths] Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed at En-rogel, for they must not be seen coming into the city. But a maidservant went and told them, and they went and told King David.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8468" class="sup">18</span>But a lad saw them and told Absalom; but they left quickly and came to the house of a man in Bahurim, who had a well in his court, and they went down into it.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8469" class="sup">19</span>And the woman spread a covering over the well's mouth and spread ground corn on it; and the thing was not discovered.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8470" class="sup">20</span>For when Absalom's servants came to the woman at the house, they said, Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said to them, They went over the brook of water. When they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8471" class="sup">21</span>After they had departed, the boys came up out of the well and went and told King David, and said, Arise and pass quickly over the river Jordan; for thus and so has Ahithophel counseled against you.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8472" class="sup">22</span>David arose and all the people with him and passed over the Jordan. By daybreak, not one was left who had not crossed.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8473" class="sup">23</span>But when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his donkey, went home to his city, put his household in order, and hanged himself and died, and was buried in the tomb of his father.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8474" class="sup">24</span>Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8475" class="sup">25</span>Absalom made Amasa captain of the army instead of Joab. Amasa was the son of an [Ishmaelite] named Ithra, who married Abigail daughter of Nahash, [half sister of David and] sister of Zeruiah, Joab's mother.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8476" class="sup">26</span>So Israel and Absalom encamped in the land of Gilead.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8477" class="sup">27</span>When David came to Mahanaim, Shobi son of Nahash of Rabbah of the Ammonites, and Machir son of Ammiel of Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite of Rogelim<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8478" class="sup">28</span>Brought beds, basins, earthen vessels, wheat, barley, meal, parched grain, beans, lentils, parched [pulse--seeds of peas and beans],<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8479" class="sup">29</span>Honey, curds, sheep, and cheese of cows for David and the people with him to eat; for they said, The people are hungry, weary, and thirsty in the wilderness.<p /> </p><p /><br /></div>

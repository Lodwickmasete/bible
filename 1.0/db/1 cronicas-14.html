<p><h2>1 Chronicles 14</h2><span id="en-AMP-10776" class="sup">1</span>AND HIRAM king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar timbers, with masons and carpenters, to build him a house.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10777" class="sup">2</span>And David perceived that the Lord had established and confirmed him as king over Israel, for his kingdom was exalted highly for His people Israel's sake.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10778" class="sup">3</span>And David took more wives to Jerusalem, and [he] became the father of more sons and daughters.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10779" class="sup">4</span>Now these are the names of the children whom he had in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10780" class="sup">5</span>Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10781" class="sup">6</span>Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10782" class="sup">7</span>Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10783" class="sup">8</span>And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, [they] all went up to seek David. And [he] heard of it and went out before them.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10784" class="sup">9</span>Now the Philistines had come and made a raid in the Valley of Rephaim.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10785" class="sup">10</span>David asked God, Shall I go up against the Philistines? And will You deliver them into my hand? And the Lord said, Go up, and I will deliver them into your hand.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10786" class="sup">11</span>So [Israel] came up to Baal-perazim, and David smote [the Philistines] there. Then David said, God has broken my enemies by my hand, like the bursting forth of waters. Therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim [Lord of breaking through].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10787" class="sup">12</span>[The Philistines] left their gods there; David commanded and they were burned.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10788" class="sup">13</span>And the Philistines again made a raid in the valley.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10789" class="sup">14</span>And David inquired again of God, and God said to him, Do not go up after them; turn away from them and come [around] upon them over opposite the mulberry trees.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10790" class="sup">15</span>And when you hear a sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry or balsam trees, then go out to battle, for God has gone out before you to smite the Philistine host.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10791" class="sup">16</span>So David did as God commanded him, and they smote the army of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gezer.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10792" class="sup">17</span>And the fame of David went out into all lands, and the Lord brought the fear of him upon all nations.<p /> </p><p /><br /></div>

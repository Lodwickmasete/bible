<p><h2>1 Corinthians 12</h2><span id="en-AMP-28634" class="sup">1</span>NOW ABOUT the spiritual gifts (the special endowments of supernatural energy), brethren, I do not want you to be misinformed.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28635" class="sup">2</span>You know that when you were heathen, you were led off after idols that could not speak [habitually] as impulse directed and whenever the occasion might arise.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28636" class="sup">3</span>Therefore I want you to understand that no one speaking under the power and influence of the [Holy] Spirit of God can [ever] say, Jesus be cursed! And no one can [really] say, Jesus is [my] Lord, except by and under the power and influence of the Holy Spirit.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28637" class="sup">4</span>Now there are distinctive varieties and distributions of endowments (gifts, <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28637a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>extraordinary powers distinguishing certain Christians, due to the power of divine grace operating in their souls by the Holy Spirit) and they vary, but the [Holy] Spirit remains the same.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28638" class="sup">5</span>And there are distinctive varieties of service and ministration, but it is the same Lord [Who is served].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28639" class="sup">6</span>And there are distinctive varieties of operation [of working to accomplish things], but it is the same God Who inspires and energizes them all in all.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28640" class="sup">7</span>But to each one is given the manifestation of the [Holy] Spirit [the evidence, the spiritual illumination of the Spirit] for good and profit.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28641" class="sup">8</span>To one is given in and through the [Holy] Spirit [the power to speak] a message of wisdom, and to another [the power to express] a word of knowledge and understanding according to the same [Holy] Spirit;<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28642" class="sup">9</span>To another [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28642b" title=" b">b</a>]</sup>wonder-working] faith by the same [Holy] Spirit, to another the extraordinary powers of healing by the one Spirit;<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28643" class="sup">10</span>To another the working of miracles, to another prophetic insight (<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28643c" title=" c">c</a>]</sup>the gift of interpreting the divine will and purpose); to another the ability to discern and distinguish between [the utterances of true] spirits [and false ones], to another various kinds of [unknown] tongues, to another the ability to interpret [such] tongues.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28644" class="sup">11</span>All these [gifts, achievements, abilities] are inspired and brought to pass by one and the same [Holy] Spirit, Who apportions to each person individually [exactly] as He chooses.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28645" class="sup">12</span>For just as the body is a unity and yet has many parts, and all the parts, though many, form [only] one body, so it is with Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One).<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28646" class="sup">13</span>For by [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28646d" title=" d">d</a>]</sup>means of the personal agency of] one [Holy] Spirit we were all, whether Jews or Greeks, slaves or free, baptized [and <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28646e" title=" e">e</a>]</sup>by baptism united together] into one body, and all made to drink of one [Holy] Spirit.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28647" class="sup">14</span>For the body does not consist of one limb or organ but of many.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28648" class="sup">15</span>If the foot should say, Because I am not the hand, I do not belong to the body, would it be therefore not [a part] of the body?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28649" class="sup">16</span>If the ear should say, Because I am not the eye, I do not belong to the body, would it be therefore not [a part] of the body?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28650" class="sup">17</span>If the whole body were an eye, where [would be the sense of] hearing? If the whole body were an ear, where [would be the sense of] smell?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28651" class="sup">18</span>But as it is, God has placed and arranged the limbs and organs in the body, each [particular one] of them, just as He wished and saw fit and with the best adaptation.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28652" class="sup">19</span>But if [the whole] were all a single organ, where would the body be?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28653" class="sup">20</span>And now there are [certainly] many limbs and organs, but a single body.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28654" class="sup">21</span>And the eye is not able to say to the hand, I have no need of you, nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28655" class="sup">22</span>But instead, there is [absolute] necessity for the parts of the body that are considered the more weak.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28656" class="sup">23</span>And those [parts] of the body which we consider rather ignoble are [the very parts] which we invest with additional honor, and our unseemly parts and those unsuitable for exposure are treated with seemliness (modesty and decorum),<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28657" class="sup">24</span>Which our more presentable parts do not require. But God has so adjusted (mingled, harmonized, and subtly proportioned the parts of) the whole body, giving the greater honor and richer endowment to the inferior parts which lack [apparent importance],<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28658" class="sup">25</span>So that there should be no division or discord or lack of adaptation [of the parts of the body to each other], but the members all alike should have a mutual interest in and care for one another.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28659" class="sup">26</span>And if one member suffers, all the parts [share] the suffering; if one member is honored, all the members [share in] the enjoyment of it.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28660" class="sup">27</span>Now you [collectively] are Christ's body and [individually] you are members of it, each part severally and distinct [each with his own place and function].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28661" class="sup">28</span>So God has appointed some in the church [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28661f" title=" f">f</a>]</sup>for His own use]: first apostles (special messengers); second prophets (inspired preachers and expounders); third teachers; then wonder-workers; then those with ability to heal the sick; helpers; administrators; [speakers in] different (unknown) tongues.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28662" class="sup">29</span>Are all apostles (special messengers)? Are all prophets (inspired interpreters of the will and purposes of God)? Are all teachers? Do all have the power of performing miracles?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28663" class="sup">30</span>Do all possess extraordinary powers of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28664" class="sup">31</span>But earnestly desire and zealously cultivate the greatest and best gifts and graces (the higher gifts and the choicest graces). And yet I will show you a still more excellent way [one that is better by far and the highest of them all--love].<p /> </p><p /><strong><br /><hr /><br /></strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-AMP-28637a"><a href="#en-AMP-28637" title="Go to 1 Corinthians 12:4">1 Corinthians 12:4</a> Joseph Thayer, A Greek-English Lexicon.</li>

<p><h2>2 Corinthians 5</h2><span id="en-AMP-28877" class="sup">1</span>FOR WE know that if the tent which is our earthly home is destroyed (dissolved), we have from God a building, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28878" class="sup">2</span>Here indeed, in this [present abode, body], we sigh and groan inwardly, because we yearn to be clothed over [we yearn to put on our celestial body like a garment, to be fitted out] with our heavenly dwelling,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28879" class="sup">3</span>So that by putting it on we may not be found naked (without a body).<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28880" class="sup">4</span>For while we are still in this tent, we groan under the burden and sigh deeply (weighed down, depressed, oppressed)--not that we want to put off the body (the clothing of the spirit), but rather that we would be further clothed, so that what is mortal (our dying body) may be swallowed up by life [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28880a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>after the resurrection].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28881" class="sup">5</span>Now He Who has fashioned us [preparing and making us fit] for this very thing is God, Who also has given us the [Holy] Spirit as a guarantee [of the fulfillment of His promise].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28882" class="sup">6</span>So then, we are always full of good and hopeful and confident courage; we know that while we are at home in the body, we are abroad from the home with the Lord [that is promised us].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28883" class="sup">7</span>For we walk by faith [we <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28883b" title=" b">b</a>]</sup>regulate our lives and conduct ourselves by our conviction or belief respecting man's relationship to God and divine things, with trust and holy fervor; thus we walk] not by sight or appearance.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28884" class="sup">8</span>[Yes] we have confident and hopeful courage and are pleased rather to be away from home out of the body and be at home with the Lord.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28885" class="sup">9</span>Therefore, whether we are at home [on earth away from Him] or away from home [and with Him], we are constantly ambitious and strive earnestly to be pleasing to Him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28886" class="sup">10</span>For we must all appear and be revealed as we are before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive [his pay] according to what he has done in the body, whether good or evil [considering <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28886c" title=" c">c</a>]</sup>what his purpose and motive have been, and what he has <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28886d" title=" d">d</a>]</sup>achieved, been busy with, and given himself and his attention to accomplishing].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28887" class="sup">11</span>Therefore, being conscious of fearing the Lord with respect and reverence, we seek to win people over [to persuade them]. But <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28887e" title=" e">e</a>]</sup>what sort of persons we are is plainly recognized and thoroughly understood by God, and I hope that it is plainly recognized and thoroughly understood also by your consciences (your inborn discernment).<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28888" class="sup">12</span>We are not commending ourselves to you again, but we are providing you with an occasion and incentive to be [rightfully] proud of us, so that you may have a reply for those who pride themselves on surface appearances [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28888f" title=" f">f</a>]</sup>on the virtues they only appear to have], although their heart is devoid of them.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28889" class="sup">13</span>For if we are beside ourselves [mad, as some say], it is for God and concerns Him; if we are in our right mind, it is for your benefit,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28890" class="sup">14</span>For the love of Christ controls and urges and impels us, because we are of the opinion and conviction that [if] One died for all, then all died;<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28891" class="sup">15</span>And He died for all, so that all those who live might live no longer to and for themselves, but to and for Him Who died and was raised again for their sake.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28892" class="sup">16</span>Consequently, from now on we estimate and regard no one from a [purely] human point of view [in terms of natural standards of value]. [No] even though we once did estimate Christ from a human viewpoint and as a man, yet now [we have such knowledge of Him that] we know Him no longer [in terms of the flesh].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28893" class="sup">17</span>Therefore if any person is [ingrafted] in Christ (the Messiah) he is a new creation (a new creature altogether); the old [previous moral and spiritual condition] has passed away. Behold, the fresh and new has come!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28894" class="sup">18</span>But all things are from God, Who through Jesus Christ reconciled us to Himself [received us into favor, brought us into harmony with Himself] and gave to us the ministry of reconciliation [that by word and deed we might aim to bring others into harmony with Him].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28895" class="sup">19</span>It was God [personally present] in Christ, reconciling and restoring the world to favor with Himself, not counting up and holding against [men] their trespasses [but cancelling them], and committing to us the message of reconciliation (of the restoration to favor).<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28896" class="sup">20</span>So we are Christ's ambassadors, God making His appeal as it were through us. We [as Christ's personal representatives] beg you for His sake to lay hold of the divine favor [now offered you] and be reconciled to God.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28897" class="sup">21</span>For our sake He made Christ [virtually] to be sin Who knew no sin, so that in and through Him we might become [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28897g" title=" g">g</a>]</sup>endued with, viewed as being in, and examples of] the righteousness of God [what we ought to be, approved and acceptable and in right relationship with Him, by His goodness].<p /> </p><p /><strong><br /><hr /><br /></strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-AMP-28880a"><a href="#en-AMP-28880" title="Go to 2 Corinthians 5:4">2 Corinthians 5:4</a> Joseph Thayer, A Greek-English Lexicon.</li>

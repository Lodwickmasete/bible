<p><h2>1 Kings 6</h2><span id="en-AMP-8898" class="sup">1</span>AND 480 years after the Israelites came out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the second month, Ziv, he began to build the Lord's house.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8899" class="sup">2</span>The length of the house Solomon built for the Lord was sixty cubits, its breadth twenty, and its height thirty cubits.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8900" class="sup">3</span>The length of the vestibule in front of the temple was twenty cubits, equal to the width of the house, and its depth in front of the house was ten cubits.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8901" class="sup">4</span>For the house he made narrow [latticed] windows.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8902" class="sup">5</span>Against the wall of the house he built chambers running round the walls of the house both of the Holy Place and of the Holy of Holies; and he made side chambers all around.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8903" class="sup">6</span>The first story's side chambers were five cubits wide, those of the middle story six cubits wide, and of the third story seven cubits wide; for around the outside of the wall of the house he made offsets in order that the supporting beams should not be thrust into the walls of the house.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8904" class="sup">7</span>When the house was being built, its stone was made ready at the quarry, and no hammer, ax, or tool of iron was heard in the house while it was in building.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8905" class="sup">8</span>The entrance to the lowest side chamber was on the right [or south] side of the house; and one went up winding stairs into the middle chamber and from the middle into the third.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8906" class="sup">9</span>So Solomon built the temple building and finished it, and roofed the house with beams and boards of cedar.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8907" class="sup">10</span>Then he built the stories of chambers [the lean-to] against all the house, each [story] five cubits high; and it was joined to the house with timbers of cedar.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8908" class="sup">11</span>Now the word of the Lord came to Solomon, saying,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8909" class="sup">12</span>Concerning this house which you are building, if you will walk in My statutes, execute My precepts, and keep all My commandments to walk in them, then I will fulfill to you My promises which I made to David your father.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8910" class="sup">13</span>And I will dwell among the Israelites and will not forsake My people Israel.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8911" class="sup">14</span>So Solomon built the house and finished it.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8912" class="sup">15</span>He built the walls of the house (the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies) within with boards of cedar, from the floor of the house to the rafters of the ceiling. He covered the inside with wood, and the floor of the house with boards of cypress.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8913" class="sup">16</span>He built twenty cubits of the rear of the house with boards of cedar from the floor to the rafters; he built it within for the sanctuary, the Holy of Holies.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8914" class="sup">17</span>The [rest of the] house, that is, the temple in front of the Holy of Holies, was forty cubits long.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8915" class="sup">18</span>The cedar on the house within was carved with gourds and open flowers. All was cedar; no stone was visible.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8916" class="sup">19</span>And he prepared the Holy of Holies in the inner room in which to set the ark of the covenant of the Lord.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8917" class="sup">20</span>The Holy of Holies was twenty cubits in length, in breadth, and in height. He overlaid it with pure gold. He also overlaid the cedar altar.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8918" class="sup">21</span>Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold, and he drew chains of gold across in front of the Holy of Holies and overlaid it with gold.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8919" class="sup">22</span>And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until all the house was finished. Also the whole [incense] altar that [stood outside the door but] belonged to the Holy of Holies he overlaid with gold.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8920" class="sup">23</span>Within the Holy of Holies he made two cherubim of olive wood, each ten cubits high.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8921" class="sup">24</span>Five cubits was the length of one wing of the cherub and five cubits its other wing; from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other was ten cubits.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8922" class="sup">25</span>The wings of the other cherub were also ten cubits. Both cherubim were the same,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8923" class="sup">26</span>The height of one cherub ten cubits, as was the other.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8924" class="sup">27</span>He put the cherubim within the inner sanctuary. Their wings were stretched out, so that the wing of one touched one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall, and their inner wings touched in the midst of the room.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8925" class="sup">28</span>Solomon overlaid the cherubim with gold.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8926" class="sup">29</span>He carved all the walls of the house (these two holy rooms) round about with figures of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers, within and without.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8927" class="sup">30</span>The floor of the house he overlaid with gold, inside and out.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8928" class="sup">31</span>For the Holy of Holies he made [folding] doors of olive wood; their entire width was one-fifth that of the wall.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8929" class="sup">32</span>On the two doors of olive wood he carved cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers; he overlaid them with gold, and spread gold on the cherubim and palm trees.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8930" class="sup">33</span>Also he made for the door of the Holy Place four-sided posts of olive wood.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8931" class="sup">34</span>The two doors were of cypress wood; the two leaves of each door were folding.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8932" class="sup">35</span>He carved on them cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers, covered with gold evenly applied on the carved work.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8933" class="sup">36</span>He built the inner court with three rows of hewn stone and a row of cedar beams.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8934" class="sup">37</span>In the fourth year the foundation of the Lord's house was laid, in the [second] month, Ziv.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8935" class="sup">38</span>In the eleventh year, in Bul, the eighth month, the house was finished throughout according to all its specifications. So he was seven years in building it.<p /> </p><p /><br /></div>

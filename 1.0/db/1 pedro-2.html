<p><h2>1 Peter 2</h2><span id="en-AMP-30399" class="sup">1</span>SO BE done with every trace of wickedness (depravity, malignity) and all deceit and insincerity (pretense, hypocrisy) and grudges (envy, jealousy) and slander and evil speaking of every kind.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30400" class="sup">2</span>Like newborn babies you should crave (thirst for, earnestly desire) the pure (unadulterated) spiritual milk, that by it you may be nurtured and grow unto [completed] salvation,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30401" class="sup">3</span>Since you have [already] tasted the goodness and kindness of the Lord.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30401A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30402" class="sup">4</span>Come to Him [then, to that] Living Stone which men <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30402a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>tried and threw away, but which is chosen [and] precious in God's sight.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30402B" title="See cross-reference B">B</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30403" class="sup">5</span>[Come] and, like living stones, be yourselves built [into] a spiritual house, for a holy (dedicated, consecrated) priesthood, to offer up [those] spiritual sacrifices [that are] acceptable and pleasing to God through Jesus Christ.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30404" class="sup">6</span>For thus it stands in Scripture: Behold, I am laying in Zion a chosen (<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30404b" title=" b">b</a>]</sup>honored), precious chief Cornerstone, and he who believes in Him [who adheres to, trusts in, and relies on Him] shall never be <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30404c" title=" c">c</a>]</sup>disappointed or put to shame.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30404C" title="See cross-reference C">C</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30405" class="sup">7</span>To you then who believe (who adhere to, trust in, and rely on Him) is the preciousness; but for those who disbelieve [it is true], The [very] Stone which the builders rejected has become the main Cornerstone,<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30405D" title="See cross-reference D">D</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30406" class="sup">8</span>And, A Stone that will cause stumbling and a Rock that will give [men] offense; they stumble because they disobey and disbelieve [God's] Word, as those [who reject Him] were destined (appointed) to do.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30407" class="sup">9</span>But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a dedicated nation, [God's] own <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30407d" title=" d">d</a>]</sup>purchased, special people, that you may set forth the wonderful deeds and display the virtues and perfections of Him Who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30407E" title="See cross-reference E">E</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30408" class="sup">10</span>Once you were not a people [at all], but now you are God's people; once you were unpitied, but now you are pitied and have received mercy.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30408F" title="See cross-reference F">F</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30409" class="sup">11</span>Beloved, I implore you as aliens and strangers and exiles [in this world] to abstain from the sensual urges (the evil desires, the passions of the flesh, your lower nature) that wage war against the soul.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30410" class="sup">12</span>Conduct yourselves properly (honorably, righteously) among the Gentiles, so that, although they may slander you as evildoers, [yet] they may by witnessing your good deeds [come to] glorify God in the day of inspection [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30410e" title=" e">e</a>]</sup>when God shall look upon you wanderers as a pastor or shepherd looks over his flock].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30411" class="sup">13</span>Be submissive to every human institution and authority for the sake of the Lord, whether it be to the emperor as supreme,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30412" class="sup">14</span>Or to governors as sent by him to bring vengeance (punishment, justice) to those who do wrong and to encourage those who do good service.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30413" class="sup">15</span>For it is God's will and intention that by doing right [your good and honest lives] should silence (muzzle, gag) the ignorant charges and ill-informed criticisms of foolish persons.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30414" class="sup">16</span>[Live] as free people, [yet] without employing your freedom as a pretext for wickedness; but [live at all times] as servants of God.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30415" class="sup">17</span>Show respect for all men [treat them honorably]. Love the brotherhood (the Christian fraternity of which Christ is the Head). Reverence God. Honor the emperor.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30416" class="sup">18</span>[You who are] household servants, be submissive to your masters with all [proper] respect, not only to those who are kind and considerate and reasonable, but also to those who are surly (overbearing, unjust, and crooked).<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30417" class="sup">19</span>For one is regarded favorably (is approved, acceptable, and thankworthy) if, as in the sight of God, he endures the pain of unjust suffering.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30418" class="sup">20</span>[After all] what <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30418f" title=" f">f</a>]</sup>kind of glory [is there in it] if, when you do wrong and are punished for it, you take it patiently? But if you bear patiently with suffering [which results] when you do right and that is undeserved, it is acceptable and pleasing to God.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30419" class="sup">21</span>For even to this were you called [it is inseparable from your vocation]. For Christ also suffered for you, leaving you [His personal] example, so that you should follow in His footsteps.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30420" class="sup">22</span>He was guilty of no sin, neither was deceit (guile) ever found on His lips.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30420G" title="See cross-reference G">G</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30421" class="sup">23</span>When He was reviled and insulted, He did not revile or offer insult in return; [when] He was abused and suffered, He made no threats [of vengeance]; but he trusted [Himself and everything] to Him Who judges fairly.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30422" class="sup">24</span>He personally bore our sins in His [own] body on the tree <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30422g" title=" g">g</a>]</sup>[as on an altar and offered Himself on it], that we might die (cease to exist) to sin and live to righteousness. By His wounds you have been healed.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30423" class="sup">25</span>For you were going astray like [so many] sheep, but now you have come back to the Shepherd and Guardian (<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30423h" title=" h">h</a>]</sup>the Bishop) of your souls.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30423H" title="See cross-reference H">H</a>)</sup><p /> </p><p /><strong><br /><hr /><br /></strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-AMP-30402a"><a href="#en-AMP-30402" title="Go to 1 Peter 2:4">1 Peter 2:4</a> Marvin Vincent, Word Studies in the New Testament.</li>

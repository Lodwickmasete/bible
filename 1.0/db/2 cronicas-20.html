<p><h2>2 Chronicles 20</h2><span id="en-AMP-11589" class="sup">1</span>AFTER THIS, the Moabites, the Ammonites, and with them the Meunites came against Jehoshaphat to battle.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11590" class="sup">2</span>It was told Jehoshaphat, A great multitude has come against you from beyond the [Dead] Sea, from Edom; and behold they are in Hazazon-tamar, which is En-gedi.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11591" class="sup">3</span>Then Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself [determinedly, as his vital need] to seek the Lord; he proclaimed a fast in all Judah.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11592" class="sup">4</span>And Judah gathered together to ask help from the Lord; even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek the Lord [yearning for Him with all their desire].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11593" class="sup">5</span>And Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem in the house of the Lord before the new court<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11594" class="sup">6</span>And said, O Lord, God of our fathers, are You not God in heaven? And do You not rule over all the kingdoms of the nations? In Your hand are power and might, so that none is able to withstand You.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11595" class="sup">7</span>Did not You, O our God, drive out the inhabitants of this land before Your people Israel and give it forever to the descendants of Abraham Your friend?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11596" class="sup">8</span>They dwelt in it and have built You a sanctuary in it for Your Name, saying,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11597" class="sup">9</span>If evil comes upon us, the sword of judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we will stand before this house and before You--for Your Name [and the symbol of Your presence] is in this house--and cry to You in our affliction, and You will hear and save.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11598" class="sup">10</span>And now behold, the men of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, whom You would not let Israel invade when they came from the land of Egypt, and whom they turned from and did not destroy--<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-11598A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-11599" class="sup">11</span>Behold, they reward us by coming to drive us out of Your possession which You have given us to inherit.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11600" class="sup">12</span>O our God, will You not exercise judgment upon them? For we have no might to stand against this great company that is coming against us. We do not know what to do, but our eyes are upon You.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11601" class="sup">13</span>And all Judah stood before the Lord, with their children and their wives.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11602" class="sup">14</span>Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jahaziel son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, in the midst of the assembly.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11603" class="sup">15</span>He said, Hearken, all Judah, you inhabitants of Jerusalem, and you King Jehoshaphat. The Lord says this to you: Be not afraid or dismayed at this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God's.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11604" class="sup">16</span>Tomorrow go down to them. Behold, they will come up by the Ascent of Ziz, and you will find them at the end of the ravine before the Wilderness of Jeruel.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11605" class="sup">17</span>You shall not need to fight in this battle; take your positions, stand still, and see the deliverance of the Lord [Who is] with you, O Judah and Jerusalem. Fear not nor be dismayed. Tomorrow go out against them, for the Lord is with you.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11606" class="sup">18</span>And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground, and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before the Lord, worshiping Him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11607" class="sup">19</span>And some Levites of the Kohathites and Korahites stood up to praise the Lord, the God of Israel, with a very loud voice.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11608" class="sup">20</span>And they rose early in the morning and went out into the Wilderness of Tekoa; and as they went out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and you inhabitants of Jerusalem! Believe in the Lord your God and you shall be established; believe and remain steadfast to His prophets and you shall prosper.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11609" class="sup">21</span>When he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers to sing to the Lord and praise Him in their holy [priestly] garments as they went out before the army, saying, Give thanks to the Lord, for His mercy and loving-kindness endure forever!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11610" class="sup">22</span>And when they began to sing and to praise, the Lord set ambushments against the men of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir who had come against Judah, and they were [self-] slaughtered;<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11611" class="sup">23</span>For [suspecting betrayal] the men of Ammon and Moab rose against those of Mount Seir, utterly destroying them. And when they had made an end of the men of Seir, they all helped to destroy one another.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11612" class="sup">24</span>And when Judah came to the watchtower of the wilderness, they looked at the multitude, and behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and none had escaped!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11613" class="sup">25</span>When Jehoshaphat and his people came to take the spoil, they found among them much cattle, goods, garments, and precious things which they took for themselves, more than they could carry away, so much they were three days in gathering the spoil.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11614" class="sup">26</span>On the fourth day they assembled in the Valley of Beracah. There they blessed the Lord. So the name of the place is still called the Valley of Beracah [blessing].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11615" class="sup">27</span>Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, Jehoshaphat leading them, to Jerusalem with joy, for the Lord had made them to rejoice over their enemies.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11616" class="sup">28</span>They came to Jerusalem with harps, lyres, and trumpets to the house of the Lord.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11617" class="sup">29</span>And the fear of God came upon all the kingdoms of those countries when they heard that the Lord had fought against the enemies of Israel.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11618" class="sup">30</span>So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet, for his God gave him rest round about.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11619" class="sup">31</span>Thus Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he began his twenty-five-year reign in Jerusalem. His mother was Azubah daughter of Shilhi.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11620" class="sup">32</span>And he walked in the ways of Asa his father and departed not from it, doing what was right in the sight of the Lord.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11621" class="sup">33</span>But the high places [of idolatry] were not taken away, for the people had not yet set their hearts on their fathers' God.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11622" class="sup">34</span>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, from first to last, they are written in the records of Jehu son of Hanani, which are in the Book of the Kings of Israel.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11623" class="sup">35</span>After this, Jehoshaphat king of Judah joined with Ahaziah king of Israel, who did very wickedly.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11624" class="sup">36</span>He joined him in building ships to go to Tarshish, building them in Ezion-geber.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11625" class="sup">37</span>Then Eliezer son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because you have joined Ahaziah, the Lord will destroy your works. So the ships were wrecked and unable to go to Tarshish.<p /> </p><p /><strong>Cross references:</strong><ol type="A"><li id="cen-AMP-11598A"><a href="#en-AMP-11598" title="Go to 2 Chronicles 20:10">2 Chronicles 20:10</a> : eut 2:9 </li>

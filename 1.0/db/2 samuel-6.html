<p><h2>2 Samuel 6</h2><span id="en-AMP-8159" class="sup">1</span>AGAIN DAVID gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, 30,000.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8160" class="sup">2</span>And [he] arose and went with all the people who were with him to Baale-judah [Kiriath-jearim] to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by the name of the Lord of hosts, Who sits enthroned above the cherubim.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8161" class="sup">3</span>And they set the ark of God upon a new cart and brought it <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-8161a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>out of the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill; and Uzzah and Ahio, sons of Abinadab, drove the new cart.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8162" class="sup">4</span>And they brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill, with the ark of God; and Ahio went before the ark.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8163" class="sup">5</span>And David and all the house of Israel played before the Lord with all their might, with songs, lyres, harps, tambourines, castanets, and cymbals.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8164" class="sup">6</span>And when they came to Nacon's threshing floor, Uzzah put out his hand to the ark of God and took hold of it, for the oxen stumbled and shook it.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8165" class="sup">7</span>And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for touching the ark, and he died there by the ark of God.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8166" class="sup">8</span>David was grieved and offended because the Lord had broken forth upon Uzzah, and that place is called Perez-uzzah [the breaking forth upon Uzzah] to this day.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8167" class="sup">9</span>David was afraid of the Lord that day and said, How can the ark of the Lord come to me?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8168" class="sup">10</span>So David was not willing to take the ark of the Lord to him into the City of David; but he took it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8169" class="sup">11</span>And the ark of the Lord remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite for three months, and the Lord blessed Obed-edom and all his household.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8170" class="sup">12</span>And it was told King David, The Lord has blessed the house of Obed-edom and all that belongs to him, because of the ark of God. So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the City of David with rejoicing;<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8171" class="sup">13</span>And when those who bore the ark of the Lord had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fatling.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8172" class="sup">14</span>And David danced before the Lord with all his might, clad in a linen ephod [a priest's upper garment].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8173" class="sup">15</span>So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the Lord with shouting and with the sound of the trumpet.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8174" class="sup">16</span>As the ark of the Lord came into the City of David, Michal, Saul's daughter [David's wife], looked out of the window and saw King David leaping and dancing before the Lord, and she despised him in her heart.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8175" class="sup">17</span>They brought in the ark of the Lord and set it in its place inside the tent which David had pitched for it, and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the Lord.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8176" class="sup">18</span>When David had finished offering the burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name [and presence] of the Lord of hosts,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8177" class="sup">19</span>And distributed among all the people, the whole multitude of Israel, both to men and women, to each a cake of bread, a portion of meat, and a cake of raisins. So all the people departed, each to his house.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8178" class="sup">20</span>Then David returned to bless his household. And [his wife] Michal daughter of Saul came out to meet David and said, How glorious was the king of Israel today, who stripped himself of his kingly robes and uncovered himself in the eyes of his servants' maids as one of the worthless fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8179" class="sup">21</span>David said to Michal, It was before the Lord, Who chose me above your father and all his house to appoint me as prince over Israel, the people of the Lord. Therefore will I make merry [in pure enjoyment] before the Lord.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8180" class="sup">22</span>I will be still more lightly esteemed than this, and will humble and lower myself in my own sight [and yours]. But by the maids you mentioned, I will be held in honor.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8181" class="sup">23</span>And Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death.<p /> </p><p /><strong><br /><hr /><br /></strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-AMP-8161a"><a href="#en-AMP-8161" title="Go to 2 Samuel 6:3">2 Samuel 6:3</a> How long had the ark been in the house of Abinadab (see I Sam. 7:2)?</li>

<p><h2>1 Samuel 16</h2><span id="en-AMP-7597" class="sup">1</span>THE LORD said to Samuel, How long will you mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? Fill your horn with oil; I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite. For I have provided for Myself a king among his sons.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7598" class="sup">2</span>Samuel said, How can I go? If Saul hears it, he will kill me. And the Lord said, Take a heifer with you and say, I have come to sacrifice to the Lord.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7599" class="sup">3</span>And invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do; and you shall anoint for Me the one I name to you.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7600" class="sup">4</span>And Samuel did what the Lord said, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming and said, Have you come peaceably?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7601" class="sup">5</span>And he said, Peaceably; I have come to sacrifice to the Lord. Consecrate yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice. And he consecrated Jesse and his sons and called them to the sacrifice.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7602" class="sup">6</span>When they had come, he looked on Eliab [the eldest son] and said, Surely the Lord's anointed is before Him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7603" class="sup">7</span>But the Lord said to Samuel, Look not on his appearance or at the height of his stature, for I have rejected him. For the Lord sees not as man sees; for man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7604" class="sup">8</span>Then Jesse called Abinadab and made him pass before Samuel. But Samuel said, Neither has the Lord chosen this one.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7605" class="sup">9</span>Then Jesse made Shammah pass by. Samuel said, Nor has the Lord chosen him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7606" class="sup">10</span>Jesse made seven of his sons pass before Samuel. And Samuel said to Jesse, The Lord has not chosen any of these.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7607" class="sup">11</span>Then [he] said to Jesse, Are all your sons here? [Jesse] said, There is yet the youngest; he is tending the sheep. Samuel said to Jesse, Send for him; for we will not sit down to eat until he is here.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7608" class="sup">12</span>Jesse sent and brought him. David had a healthy reddish complexion and beautiful eyes, and was fine-looking. The Lord said [to Samuel], Arise, anoint him; this is he.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7609" class="sup">13</span>Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed David in the midst of his brothers; and the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon David from that day forward. And Samuel arose and went to Ramah.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7610" class="sup">14</span>But the Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord tormented and troubled him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7611" class="sup">15</span>Saul's servants said to him, Behold, an evil spirit from God torments you.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7612" class="sup">16</span>Let our lord now command your servants here before you to find a man who plays skillfully on the lyre; and when the evil spirit from God is upon you, he will play it, and you will be well.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7613" class="sup">17</span>Saul told his servants, Find me a man who plays well and bring him to me.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7614" class="sup">18</span>One of the young men said, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite who plays skillfully, a valiant man, a man of war, prudent in speech and eloquent, an attractive person; and the Lord is with him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7615" class="sup">19</span>So Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, Send me David your son, who is with the sheep.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7616" class="sup">20</span>And Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, a skin of wine, and a kid and sent them by David his son to Saul.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7617" class="sup">21</span>And David came to Saul and served him. Saul became very fond of him, and he became his armor-bearer.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7618" class="sup">22</span>Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David remain in my service, for he pleases me.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7619" class="sup">23</span>And when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, David took a lyre and played it; so Saul was refreshed and became well, and the evil spirit left him.<p /> </p><p /><br /></div>

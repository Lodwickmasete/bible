<p><h2>Revelation 14</h2><span id="en-AMP-30927" class="sup">1</span>THEN I looked, and behold, the Lamb stood on Mount Zion, and with Him 144,000 [men] who had His name and His Father's name inscribed on their foreheads.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30928" class="sup">2</span>And I heard a voice from heaven like the sound of great waters and like the rumbling of mighty thunder; the voice I heard [seemed like the music] of harpists <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30928a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>accompanying themselves on their harps.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30929" class="sup">3</span>And they sang a new song before the throne [of God] and before the four living creatures and before the elders [of <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30929b" title=" b">b</a>]</sup>the heavenly Sanhedrin]. No one could learn [to sing] that song except the 144,000 who had been ransomed (purchased, redeemed) from the earth.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30930" class="sup">4</span>These are they who have not defiled themselves by relations with women, for they are [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30930c" title=" c">c</a>]</sup>pure as] virgins. These are they who follow the Lamb wherever He goes. These are they who have been ransomed (purchased, redeemed) from among men as the firstfruits for God and the Lamb.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30931" class="sup">5</span>No lie was found to be upon their lips, for they are blameless (spotless, untainted, without blemish) before the throne of God.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30932" class="sup">6</span>Then I saw another angel flying in midair, with an eternal Gospel (good news) to tell to the inhabitants of the earth, to every race and tribe and language and people.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30933" class="sup">7</span>And he cried with a mighty voice, Revere God and give Him glory (honor and praise in worship), for the hour of His judgment has arrived. Fall down before Him; pay Him homage and adoration and worship Him Who created heaven and earth, the sea and the springs (fountains) of water.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30934" class="sup">8</span>Then another angel, a second, followed, declaring, Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great! She who made all nations drink of the [maddening] wine of her passionate unchastity [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30934d" title=" d">d</a>]</sup> idolatry].<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30934A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30935" class="sup">9</span>Then another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a mighty voice, Whoever pays homage to the beast and his statue and permits the [beast's] stamp (mark, inscription) to be put on his forehead or on his hand,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30936" class="sup">10</span>He too shall [have to] drink of the wine of God's indignation and wrath, poured undiluted into the cup of His anger; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30936B" title="See cross-reference B">B</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30937" class="sup">11</span>And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever; and they have no respite (no pause, no intermission, no rest, no peace) day or night--these who pay homage to the beast and to his image and whoever receives the stamp of his name upon him.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30937C" title="See cross-reference C">C</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30938" class="sup">12</span>Here [comes in a call for] the steadfastness of the saints [the patience, the endurance of the people of God], those who [habitually] keep God's commandments and [their] faith in Jesus.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30939" class="sup">13</span>Then I heard further [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30939e" title=" e">e</a>]</sup> perceiving the distinct words of] a voice from heaven, saying, Write this: Blessed (happy, <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30939f" title=" f">f</a>]</sup>to be envied) are the dead from now on who die in the Lord! Yes, blessed (happy, <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30939g" title=" g">g</a>]</sup>to be envied indeed), says the Spirit, [in] that they may rest from their labors, for their works (deeds) do follow (attend, accompany) them!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30940" class="sup">14</span>Again I looked, and behold, [I saw] a white cloud, and sitting on the cloud <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30940h" title=" h">h</a>]</sup>One resembling a Son of Man, with a crown of gold on His head and a sharp scythe (sickle) in His hand.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30940D" title="See cross-reference D">D</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30941" class="sup">15</span>And another angel came out of the temple sanctuary, calling with a mighty voice to Him Who was sitting upon the cloud, Put in Your scythe and reap, for the hour has arrived to gather the harvest, for the earth's crop is fully ripened.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30941E" title="See cross-reference E">E</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30942" class="sup">16</span>So He Who was sitting upon the cloud swung His scythe (sickle) on the earth, and the earth's crop was harvested.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30943" class="sup">17</span>Then another angel came out of the temple [sanctuary] in heaven, and he also carried a sharp scythe (sickle).<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30944" class="sup">18</span>And another angel came forth from the altar, [the angel] who has authority and power over fire, and he called with a loud cry to him who had the sharp scythe (sickle), Put forth your scythe and reap the fruitage of the vine of the earth, for its grapes are entirely ripe.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30945" class="sup">19</span>So the angel swung his scythe on the earth and stripped the grapes and gathered the vintage from the vines of the earth and cast it into the huge winepress of God's indignation and wrath.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30946" class="sup">20</span>And [the grapes in] the winepress were trodden outside the city, and blood poured from the winepress, [reaching] as high as horses' bridles, for a distance of 1,600 stadia (about 200 miles).<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30946F" title="See cross-reference F">F</a>)</sup><p /> </p><p /><strong><br /><hr /><br /></strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-AMP-30928a"><a href="#en-AMP-30928" title="Go to Revelation 14:2">Revelation 14:2</a> Marvin Vincent, Word Studies.</li>

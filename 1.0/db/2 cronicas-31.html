<p><h2>2 Chronicles 31</h2><span id="en-AMP-11856" class="sup">1</span>NOW WHEN all this was finished, all Israel present there went out to the cities of Judah and broke in pieces the pillars or obelisks, cut down the Asherim, and threw down the high places [of idolatry] and the altars in all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim and Manasseh, until they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the Israelites returned to their own cities, every man to his possession.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11857" class="sup">2</span>And Hezekiah appointed the priests and the Levites after their divisions, each man according to his service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister, to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the camp of the Lord.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11858" class="sup">3</span>King Hezekiah's personal contribution was for the burnt offerings: [those] of morning and evening, for the Sabbaths, for the New Moons, and for the appointed feasts, as written in the Law of the Lord.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11859" class="sup">4</span>He commanded the people living in Jerusalem to give the portion due the priests and Levites, that they might [be free to] give themselves to the Law of the Lord.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11860" class="sup">5</span>As soon as the command went abroad, the Israelites gave in abundance the firstfruits of grain, vintage fruit, oil, honey, and of all the produce of the field; and they brought in abundantly the tithe of everything.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11861" class="sup">6</span>The people of Israel and Judah who lived in Judah's cities also brought the tithe of cattle and sheep and of the dedicated things which were consecrated to the Lord their God, and they laid them in heaps.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11862" class="sup">7</span>In the third month [at the end of wheat harvest] they began to lay the foundation or beginning of the heaps and finished them in the seventh month.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11863" class="sup">8</span>When Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed the Lord and His people Israel.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11864" class="sup">9</span>Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and Levites about the heaps.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11865" class="sup">10</span>Azariah the high priest, of the house of Zadok, answered him, Since the people began to bring the offerings into the Lord's house, we have eaten and have plenty left, for the Lord has blessed His people, and what is left is this great store.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11866" class="sup">11</span>Then Hezekiah commanded them to prepare chambers [for storage] in the house of the Lord, and they prepared them<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11867" class="sup">12</span>And brought in the offerings, tithes, and dedicated things faithfully. Conaniah the Levite was in charge of them, and Shimei his brother came next.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11868" class="sup">13</span>And Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah were overseers directed by Conaniah and Shimei his brother, at the appointment of King Hezekiah and Azariah the chief officer of the house of God.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11869" class="sup">14</span>Kore son of Imnah the Levite, keeper of the East Gate, was over the freewill offerings to God, to apportion the contributions of the Lord and the most holy things.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11870" class="sup">15</span>Under him were Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the priests' cities, in their office of trust faithfully to give to their brethren by divisions, to great and small alike,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11871" class="sup">16</span>Except those [Levites] registered as males from three years old and upward--who were consecrated to the temple service [in Jerusalem, for their daily portion] as the duty of every day required, for their service according to their offices by their divisions.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11872" class="sup">17</span>The registration of the priests was according to their fathers' houses; that of the Levites from twenty years old and upward was according to their offices by their divisions;<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11873" class="sup">18</span>Also there was the registration of all their little ones, their wives, and their older sons and daughters through all the congregation. For in their office of trust they cleansed themselves and set themselves apart in holiness.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11874" class="sup">19</span>Also for the sons of Aaron the priests, who were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities or in every city, there were men who were mentioned by name to give portions to all the males among the priests and to all who were registered among the Levites.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11875" class="sup">20</span>Hezekiah did this throughout all Judah, and he did what was good, right, and faithful before the Lord his God.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11876" class="sup">21</span>And every work that he began in the service of the house of God, in keeping with the law and the commandments to seek his God [inquiring of and yearning for Him], he did with all his heart, and he prospered.<p /> </p><p /><br /></div>

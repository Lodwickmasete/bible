<p><h2>1 Samuel 3</h2><span id="en-AMP-7278" class="sup">1</span>NOW THE boy Samuel ministered to the Lord before Eli. The word of the Lord was rare and precious in those days; there was no frequent or widely spread vision.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7279" class="sup">2</span>At that time Eli, whose eyesight had dimmed so that he could not see, was lying down in his own place.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7280" class="sup">3</span>The lamp of God had not yet gone out in the temple of the Lord, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was lying down<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7281" class="sup">4</span>When the Lord called, Samuel! And he answered, Here I am.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7282" class="sup">5</span>He ran to Eli and said, Here I am, for you called me. Eli said, I did not call you; lie down again. So he went and lay down.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7283" class="sup">6</span>And the Lord called again, Samuel! And Samuel arose and went to Eli and said, Here am I; you did call me. Eli answered, I did not call, my son; lie down again.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7284" class="sup">7</span>Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord, and the word of the Lord was not yet revealed to him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7285" class="sup">8</span>And the Lord called Samuel the third time. And he went to Eli and said, Here I am, for you did call me. Then Eli perceived that the Lord was calling the boy.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7286" class="sup">9</span>So Eli said to Samuel, Go, lie down. And if He calls you, you shall say, Speak, Lord, for Your servant is listening. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7287" class="sup">10</span>And the Lord came and stood and called as at other times, Samuel! Samuel! Then Samuel answered, Speak, Lord, for Your servant is listening.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7288" class="sup">11</span>The Lord told Samuel, Behold, I am about to do a thing in Israel at which both ears of all who hear it shall tingle.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7289" class="sup">12</span>On that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from beginning to end.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7290" class="sup">13</span>And I [now] announce to him that I will judge and punish his house forever for the iniquity of which he knew, for his sons were bringing a curse upon themselves [blaspheming God], and he did not restrain them.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7291" class="sup">14</span>Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be atoned for or purged with sacrifice or offering forever.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7292" class="sup">15</span>Samuel lay until morning; then he opened the doors of the Lord's house. And [he] was afraid to tell the vision to Eli.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7293" class="sup">16</span>But Eli called Samuel and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here I am.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7294" class="sup">17</span>Eli said, What is it He told you? Pray do not hide it from me. May God do so to you, and more also, if you hide anything from me of all that He said to you.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7295" class="sup">18</span>And Samuel told him everything, hiding nothing. And Eli said, It is the Lord; let Him do what seems good to Him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7296" class="sup">19</span>Samuel grew; the Lord was with him and let none of his words fall to the ground.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-7296A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-7297" class="sup">20</span>And all Israel from Dan to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the Lord.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7298" class="sup">21</span>And the Lord continued to appear in Shiloh, for the Lord revealed Himself to Samuel in Shiloh through the word of the Lord.<p /> </p><p /><strong>Cross references:</strong><ol type="A"><li id="cen-AMP-7296A"><a href="#en-AMP-7296" title="Go to 1 Samuel 3:19">1 Samuel 3:19</a> : osh 23:14 </li>

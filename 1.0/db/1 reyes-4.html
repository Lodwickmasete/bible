But archaeological discoveries prove that "precisely during the period 1100-900 B.C., when the kingdom of Israel was being built up, 'the weak and inglorious twenty-first dynasty' was ruling in Egypt and at the same time Assyria went into a period of decline" (J. P. Free, Archaeology and Bible History, citing A. T. Olmstead, History of Assyria).</li>

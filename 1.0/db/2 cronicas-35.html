<p><h2>2 Chronicles 35</h2><span id="en-AMP-11968" class="sup">1</span>JOSIAH KEPT the Passover to the Lord in Jerusalem; they killed the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the first month.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11969" class="sup">2</span>He appointed the priests to their positions and encouraged them in the service of the house of the Lord.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11970" class="sup">3</span>To the Levites who taught all Israel and were holy to the Lord he said: Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon son of David king of Israel, built; it shall no longer be a burden carried on your shoulders. Now serve the Lord your God and His people Israel.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11971" class="sup">4</span>Prepare yourselves according to your fathers' houses by your divisions, after the directions of David king of Israel and of Solomon his son.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11972" class="sup">5</span>And stand in the holy court of the priests according to the sections of the fathers' families of your kinsmen, the common people, and let there be a section of the Levites [to attend] to each division of the families of the people.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11973" class="sup">6</span>Kill the Passover lambs and sanctify yourselves and prepare for your brethren to do according to the word of the Lord by Moses.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11974" class="sup">7</span>Then Josiah contributed to the lay people lambs and kids of the flock as Passover offerings for all who were present, to the number of 30,000, and 3,000 young bulls--all from the king's possessions.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11975" class="sup">8</span>And his princes gave for a freewill offering to the people, to the priests, and the Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, chief officers of God's house, gave the priests for the Passover offerings 2,600 [lambs and kids] and 300 bulls.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11976" class="sup">9</span>Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethanel his brothers, and Hashabiah, Jeiel, and Jozabad, chiefs of the Levites, gave to the Levites for Passover offerings 5,000 [lambs and kids] and 500 bulls.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11977" class="sup">10</span>When the service was ready, the priests stood in their place and the Levites in their divisions as the king commanded.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11978" class="sup">11</span>They killed the Passover lambs, and the priests sprinkled the blood they received from the Levites who skinned the animals.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11979" class="sup">12</span>Then they removed the burnt offerings, that they might distribute them according to the divisions of the lay families to offer to the Lord, as directed in the Book of Moses. And so they did with the bulls.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11980" class="sup">13</span>And they roasted the Passover lambs with fire according to the ordinance; and they cooked the holy offerings in pots, in caldrons, and in pans and carried them quickly to all the people.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11981" class="sup">14</span>Afterward [the Levites] prepared for themselves and the priests, because the priests, the sons of Aaron, were busy in offering the burnt offerings and the fat until night; so the Levites prepared for themselves and also for the priests, the sons of Aaron.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11982" class="sup">15</span>The singers, the sons of Asaph, were in their places according to the command of David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun the king's seer. And the gatekeepers were at every gate; they did not need to leave their service, for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11983" class="sup">16</span>So all the Lord's service was prepared the same day to keep the Passover and to offer burnt offerings upon the Lord's altar, as King Josiah commanded.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11984" class="sup">17</span>And the Israelites who were present kept the Passover at that time, and the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11985" class="sup">18</span>No Passover like it had been kept in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet, even by any of the kings of Israel, as was kept by Josiah and the priests, the Levites, and all Judah and Israel who were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11986" class="sup">19</span>In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah this Passover was kept.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11987" class="sup">20</span>After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Neco king of Egypt went out to fight against Carchemish on the Euphrates, and Josiah went out against him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11988" class="sup">21</span>But [Neco] sent ambassadors to [Josiah], saying, What have I to do with you, you king of Judah? I come not against you this day, but against the house with which I am at war; and God has commanded me to make haste. Refrain from opposing God, Who is with me, lest He destroy you.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11989" class="sup">22</span>Yet Josiah would not turn away from him, but disguised himself in order to fight with him. He did not heed the words of Neco from the mouth of God, but came to fight with him in the valley of Megiddo.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11990" class="sup">23</span>And the archers shot King Josiah, and the king said to his servants, Take me away, for I am severely wounded.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11991" class="sup">24</span>So his servants took him out of the chariot and put him in his second chariot and brought him to Jerusalem. And he died and was buried in the tombs of his fathers. All Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11992" class="sup">25</span>Jeremiah gave a lament for Josiah, and all the singing men and women have spoken of Josiah in their laments to this day. They made them an ordinance in Israel; behold, they are written in the Laments.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-11992A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-11993" class="sup">26</span>Now the rest of the acts of Josiah and his deeds, according to what is written in the Law of the Lord,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11994" class="sup">27</span>And his acts, from first to last, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.<p /> </p><p /><strong>Cross references:</strong><ol type="A"><li id="cen-AMP-11992A"><a href="#en-AMP-11992" title="Go to 2 Chronicles 35:25">2 Chronicles 35:25</a> : am 4:20 </li>

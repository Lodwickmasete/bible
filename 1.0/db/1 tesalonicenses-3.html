<p><h2>1 Thessalonians 3</h2><span id="en-AMP-29590" class="sup">1</span>THEREFORE, WHEN [the suspense of separation and our yearning for some personal communication from you] became intolerable, we consented to being left behind alone at Athens.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29591" class="sup">2</span>And we sent Timothy, our brother and God's servant in [spreading] the good news (the Gospel) of Christ, to strengthen and establish and to exhort and comfort and encourage you in your faith,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29592" class="sup">3</span>That no one [of you] should be disturbed and beguiled and led astray by these afflictions and difficulties [to which I have referred]. For you yourselves know that this is [unavoidable in our position, and must be recognized as] our appointed lot.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29593" class="sup">4</span>For even when we were with you, [you know] we warned you plainly beforehand that we were to be pressed with difficulties and made to suffer affliction, just as to your own knowledge it has [since] happened.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29594" class="sup">5</span>That is the reason that, when I could bear [the suspense] no longer, I sent that I might learn [how you were standing the strain, and the endurance of] your faith, [for I was fearful] lest somehow the tempter had tempted you and our toil [among you should prove to] be fruitless and to no purpose.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29595" class="sup">6</span>But now that Timothy has just come back to us from [his visit to] you and has brought us the good news of [the steadfastness of] your faith and [the warmth of your] love, and [reported] how kindly you cherish a constant and affectionate remembrance of us [and that you are] longing to see us as we [are to see] you,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29596" class="sup">7</span>Brethren, for this reason, in [spite of all] our stress and crushing difficulties we have been filled with comfort and cheer about you [because of] your faith (<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-29596a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>the leaning of your whole personality on God in complete trust and confidence).<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29597" class="sup">8</span>Because now we [really] live, if you stand [firm] in the Lord.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29598" class="sup">9</span>For what [adequate] thanksgiving can we render to God for you for all the gladness and delight which we enjoy for your sakes before our God?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29599" class="sup">10</span>[And we] continue to pray especially and with most intense earnestness night and day that we may see you face to face and mend and make good whatever may be imperfect and lacking in your faith.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29600" class="sup">11</span>Now may our God and Father Himself and our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) guide our steps to you.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29601" class="sup">12</span>And may the Lord make you to increase and excel and overflow in love for one another and for all people, just as we also do for you,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29602" class="sup">13</span>So that He may strengthen and confirm and establish your hearts faultlessly pure and unblamable in holiness in the sight of our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) with all His saints (the <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-29602b" title=" b">b</a>]</sup>holy and glorified people of God)!

<p><h2>1 Corinthians 2</h2><span id="en-AMP-28394" class="sup">1</span>AS FOR myself, brethren, when I came to you, I did not come proclaiming to you the testimony and evidence or <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28394a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>mystery and secret of God [concerning what He has done through Christ for the salvation of men] in lofty words of eloquence or human philosophy and wisdom;<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28395" class="sup">2</span>For I resolved to know nothing (to be acquainted with nothing, to make a display of the knowledge of nothing, and to be conscious of nothing) among you except Jesus Christ (the Messiah) and Him crucified.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28396" class="sup">3</span>And I was in (<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28396b" title=" b">b</a>]</sup>passed into a state of) weakness and fear (dread) and great trembling [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28396c" title=" c">c</a>]</sup>after I had come] among you.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28397" class="sup">4</span>And my language and my message were not set forth in persuasive (enticing and plausible) words of wisdom, but they were in demonstration of the [Holy] Spirit and power [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28397d" title=" d">d</a>]</sup>a proof by the Spirit and power of God, operating on me and stirring in the minds of my hearers the most holy emotions and thus persuading them],<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28398" class="sup">5</span>So that your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men (human philosophy), but in the power of God.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28399" class="sup">6</span>Yet when we are among the full-grown (spiritually mature Christians who are ripe in understanding), we do impart a [higher] wisdom (the knowledge of the divine plan previously hidden); but it is indeed not a wisdom of this present age or of this world nor of the leaders and rulers of this age, who are being brought to nothing and are doomed to pass away.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28400" class="sup">7</span>But rather what we are setting forth is a wisdom of God once hidden [from the human understanding] and now revealed to us by God--[that wisdom] which God devised and decreed before the ages for our glorification [to lift us into the glory of His presence].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28401" class="sup">8</span>None of the rulers of this age or world perceived and recognized and understood this, for if they had, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28402" class="sup">9</span>But, on the contrary, as the Scripture says, What eye has not seen and ear has not heard and has not entered into the heart of man, [all that] God has prepared (made and keeps ready) for those who love Him [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28402e" title=" e">e</a>]</sup>who hold Him in affectionate reverence, promptly obeying Him and gratefully recognizing the benefits He has bestowed].<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-28402A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-28403" class="sup">10</span>Yet to us God has unveiled and revealed them by and through His Spirit, for the [Holy] Spirit searches diligently, exploring and examining everything, even sounding the profound and bottomless things of God [the <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28403f" title=" f">f</a>]</sup>divine counsels and things hidden and beyond man's scrutiny].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28404" class="sup">11</span>For what person perceives (knows and understands) what passes through a man's thoughts except the man's own spirit within him? Just so no one discerns (comes to know and comprehend) the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28405" class="sup">12</span>Now we have not received the spirit [that belongs to] the world, but the [Holy] Spirit Who is from God, [given to us] that we might realize and comprehend and appreciate the gifts [of divine favor and blessing so freely and lavishly] bestowed on us by God.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28406" class="sup">13</span>And we are setting these truths forth in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the [Holy] Spirit, combining and interpreting spiritual truths with spiritual language [to those who possess the Holy Spirit].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28407" class="sup">14</span>But the natural, nonspiritual man does not accept or welcome or admit into his heart the gifts and teachings and revelations of the Spirit of God, for they are folly (meaningless nonsense) to him; and he is incapable of knowing them [of progressively recognizing, understanding, and becoming better acquainted with them] because they are spiritually discerned and estimated and appreciated.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28408" class="sup">15</span>But the spiritual man tries all things [he <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28408g" title=" g">g</a>]</sup>examines, investigates, inquires into, questions, and discerns all things], yet is himself to be put on trial and judged by no one [he can read the meaning of everything, but no one can properly discern or appraise or get an insight into him].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28409" class="sup">16</span>For who has known or understood the mind (the counsels and purposes) of the Lord so as to guide and instruct Him and give Him knowledge? But we have the mind of Christ (the Messiah) and do hold the thoughts (feelings and purposes) of His heart.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-28409B" title="See cross-reference B">B</a>)</sup><p /> </p><p /><strong><br /><hr /><br /></strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-AMP-28394a"><a href="#en-AMP-28394" title="Go to 1 Corinthians 2:1">1 Corinthians 2:1</a> Many ancient manuscripts so read.</li>

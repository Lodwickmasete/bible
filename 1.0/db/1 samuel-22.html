<p><h2>1 Samuel 22</h2><span id="en-AMP-7789" class="sup">1</span>SO DAVID departed and escaped to the cave of Adullam: and when his brothers and all his father's house heard it, they went down there to him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7790" class="sup">2</span>And everyone in distress or in debt or discontented gathered to him, and he became a commander over them. And there were with him about 400 men.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7791" class="sup">3</span>And David went from there to Mizpah of Moab; and he said to the king of Moab, Let my father [of Moabite descent] and my mother, I pray you, come out [of Judah] and be with you till I know what God will do for me.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-7791A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-7792" class="sup">4</span>And he brought them before the king of Moab, and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the stronghold [in Moab].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7793" class="sup">5</span>Then the prophet Gad said to David, Do not remain in the stronghold; leave, and get into the land of Judah. So David left and went into the forest of Hareth.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7794" class="sup">6</span>Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men that were with him. Saul was sitting in Gibeah under the tamarisk tree on the height, his spear in his hand and all his servants standing about him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7795" class="sup">7</span>Saul said to his servants who stood about him, Hear now, you Benjamites! Will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards and make you all commanders of thousands and hundreds,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7796" class="sup">8</span>That all of you have conspired against me? No one discloses to me when my son makes a league with the son of Jesse. None of you is sorry for me or discloses that my son has stirred up my servant against me to lie in wait, as he does this day?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7797" class="sup">9</span>Then Doeg the Edomite, who stood with Saul's servants, said, I saw the son of Jesse come to Nob, to Ahimelech son of Ahitub.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7798" class="sup">10</span>And [Ahimelech] inquired of the Lord for him, and gave him provisions and the sword of Goliath the Philistine.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7799" class="sup">11</span>Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father's house, the priests who were at Nob, and they all came to the king.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7800" class="sup">12</span>Saul said, Hear now, you son of Ahitub. He replied, Here I am, my lord.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7801" class="sup">13</span>Saul said to him, Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, giving him bread and a sword and inquiring of God for him, so he could rise against me to lie in wait, as he does this day?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7802" class="sup">14</span>Then Ahimelech answered the king, And who is so faithful among all your servants as David, who is the king's son-in-law, and is taken into your council and honored in your house?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7803" class="sup">15</span>Have I only today begun inquiring of God for him? No! Let not the king impute any wrong to his servant or to all the house of my father, for your servant has known nothing of all this, little or much.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7804" class="sup">16</span>[Saul] said, You shall surely die, Ahimelech, you and all your father's house.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7805" class="sup">17</span>And the king said to the guard that stood about him, Turn and slay the Lord's priests, because their hand also is with David and because they knew that he fled and did not disclose it to me. But the servants of the king would not put forth their hands against the Lord's priests.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7806" class="sup">18</span>The king said to Doeg, You turn and fall upon the priests. And Doeg the Edomite turned and attacked the priests and slew that day eighty-five persons who wore the priest's linen ephod.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7807" class="sup">19</span>And Nob, the city of the priests, he smote with the sword; both men and women, children and sucklings, oxen and donkeys and sheep, he put to the sword.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7808" class="sup">20</span>And one of the sons of Ahimelech son of Ahitub named Abiathar escaped and fled after David.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7809" class="sup">21</span>And Abiathar told David that Saul had slain the Lord's priests.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7810" class="sup">22</span>David said to Abiathar, I knew that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would surely tell Saul. I have occasioned the death of all your father's house.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7811" class="sup">23</span>Stay with me, fear not; for he who seeks my life seeks your life. But with me you shall be safeguarded.<p /> </p><p /><strong>Cross references:</strong><ol type="A"><li id="cen-AMP-7791A"><a href="#en-AMP-7791" title="Go to 1 Samuel 22:3">1 Samuel 22:3</a> : uth 4:13, 17 </li>

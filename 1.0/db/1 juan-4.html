<p><h2>1 John 4</h2><span id="en-AMP-30603" class="sup">1</span>BELOVED, DO not put faith in every spirit, but prove (test) the spirits to discover whether they proceed from God; for many false prophets have gone forth into the world.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30604" class="sup">2</span>By this you may know (perceive and recognize) the Spirit of God: every spirit which acknowledges and confesses [the fact] that Jesus Christ (the Messiah) [actually] has become man and has come in the flesh is of God [has God for its source];<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30605" class="sup">3</span>And every spirit which does not acknowledge and confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh [but would <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30605a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>annul, destroy, <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30605b" title=" b">b</a>]</sup>sever, disunite Him] is not of God [does not proceed from Him]. This [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30605c" title=" c">c</a>]</sup>nonconfession] is the [spirit] of the antichrist, [of] which you heard that it was coming, and now it is already in the world.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30606" class="sup">4</span>Little children, you are of God [you belong to Him] and have [already] defeated and overcome them [the agents of the antichrist], because He Who lives in you is greater (mightier) than he who is in the world.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30607" class="sup">5</span>They proceed from the world and are of the world; therefore it is out of the world [its <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30607d" title=" d">d</a>]</sup>whole economy morally considered] that they speak, and the world listens (pays attention) to them.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30608" class="sup">6</span>We are [children] of God. Whoever is learning to know God [progressively to perceive, recognize, and understand God by observation and experience, and to <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30608e" title=" e">e</a>]</sup>get an ever-clearer knowledge of Him] listens to us; and he who is not of God does not listen or pay attention to us. By this we know (recognize) the Spirit of Truth and the spirit of error.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30609" class="sup">7</span>Beloved, let us love one another, for love is (springs) from God; and he who loves [his fellowmen] is begotten (born) of God and is coming [progressively] to know and understand God [to perceive and recognize and get a better and clearer knowledge of Him].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30610" class="sup">8</span>He who does not love has not become acquainted with God [does not and never did know Him], for God is love.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30611" class="sup">9</span>In this the love of God was made manifest (displayed) where we are concerned: in that God sent His Son, the only begotten or <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30611f" title=" f">f</a>]</sup>unique [Son], into the world so that we might live through Him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30612" class="sup">10</span>In this is love: not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation (the atoning sacrifice) for our sins.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30613" class="sup">11</span>Beloved, if God loved us so [very much], we also ought to love one another.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30614" class="sup">12</span>No man has at any time [yet] seen God. But if we love one another, God abides (lives and remains) in us and His love (that love which is essentially His) is brought to completion (to its full maturity, runs its full course, is perfected) in us!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30615" class="sup">13</span>By this we come to know (perceive, recognize, and understand) that we abide (live and remain) in Him and He in us: because He has given (imparted) to us of His [Holy] Spirit.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30616" class="sup">14</span>And [besides] we ourselves have seen (have deliberately and steadfastly contemplated) and bear witness that the Father has sent the Son [as the] Savior of the world.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30617" class="sup">15</span>Anyone who confesses (acknowledges, owns) that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides (lives, makes His home) in him and he [abides, lives, makes his home] in God.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30618" class="sup">16</span>And we know (understand, recognize, are conscious of, by observation and by experience) and believe (adhere to and put faith in and rely on) the love God cherishes for us. God is love, and he who dwells and continues in love dwells and continues in God, and God dwells and continues in him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30619" class="sup">17</span>In this [union and communion with Him] love is brought to completion and attains perfection with us, that we may have confidence for the day of judgment [with assurance and boldness to face Him], because as He is, so are we in this world.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30620" class="sup">18</span>There is no fear in love [dread does not exist], but full-grown (complete, perfect) love <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30620g" title=" g">g</a>]</sup>turns fear out of doors and expels every trace of terror! For fear <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30620h" title=" h">h</a>]</sup>brings with it the thought of punishment, and [so] he who is afraid has not reached the full maturity of love [is not yet grown into love's complete perfection].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30621" class="sup">19</span>We love Him, because He first loved us.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30622" class="sup">20</span>If anyone says, I love God, and hates (detests, abominates) his brother [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30622i" title=" i">i</a>]</sup>in Christ], he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love God, Whom he has not seen.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30623" class="sup">21</span>And this command (charge, order, injunction) we have from Him: that he who loves God shall love his brother [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30623j" title=" j">j</a>]</sup>believer] also.<p /> </p><p /><strong><br /><hr /><br /></strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-AMP-30605a"><a href="#en-AMP-30605" title="Go to 1 John 4:3">1 John 4:3</a> An ancient reading.</li>

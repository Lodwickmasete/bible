<p><h2>2 Kings 21</h2><span id="en-AMP-10121" class="sup">1</span>MANASSEH WAS twelve years old when he began his fifty-five-year [wicked] reign in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Hephzibah.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10122" class="sup">2</span>He [Hezekiah's son] did evil in the sight of the Lord, after the [idolatrous] practices of the [heathen] nations whom the Lord cast out before the Israelites.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10123" class="sup">3</span>For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal and made an Asherah, as did Ahab king of Israel, and worshiped all the [starry] hosts of the heavens and served them!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10124" class="sup">4</span>And he built [heathen] altars in the house of the Lord, of which the Lord said, In Jerusalem will I put My <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-10124a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>Name [and the pledge of My presence].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10125" class="sup">5</span>And he [good Hezekiah's son] built altars for all the hosts of the heavens in the two courts of the house of the Lord!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10126" class="sup">6</span>And he made his son pass through the fire and burned him as an offering [to Molech]; he practiced soothsaying and augury, and dealt with mediums and wizards! He did much wickedness in the sight of the Lord, provoking Him to anger.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10127" class="sup">7</span>He made a graven image of [the goddess] Asherah and set it in the house, of which the Lord said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put My Name [and the pledge of My presence] forever;<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10128" class="sup">8</span>And I will not cause the feet of Israel to wander any more out of the land which I gave their fathers, if only they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them and according to all the law that My servant Moses commanded them.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10129" class="sup">9</span>But they would not listen; and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil than the nations did whom the Lord destroyed before the Israelites!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10130" class="sup">10</span>And the Lord said through His servants the prophets:<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10131" class="sup">11</span>Because Manasseh king of Judah has committed these abominations, and has done wickedly above all that the Amorites did who were before him, and has made Judah also to sin with his idols,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10132" class="sup">12</span>Therefore thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Behold, I am bringing such evil upon Jerusalem and Judah, that whoever hears of it, both his ears shall tingle!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10133" class="sup">13</span>And I will stretch over Jerusalem the measuring line of Samaria and the plummet of the house of Ahab; and I will wipe Jerusalem as one wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10134" class="sup">14</span>And I will cast off the rest of My inheritance and deliver them into the hands of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10135" class="sup">15</span>For they have done evil in My sight and have provoked Me to anger since their fathers came out of Egypt to this day.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10136" class="sup">16</span>Moreover, Manasseh shed very much innocent blood, filling Jerusalem from one end to another--besides his sin in making Judah sin, by doing evil in the sight of the Lord!<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-10136A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-10137" class="sup">17</span>The rest of the acts of Manasseh, all that he did, and his sin that he committed, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10138" class="sup">18</span>Manasseh slept with his fathers and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza.

<p><h2>1 John 1</h2><span id="en-AMP-30540" class="sup">1</span>[WE ARE writing] about the Word of Life [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30540a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>in] Him Who existed from the beginning, Whom we have heard, Whom we have seen with our [own] eyes, Whom we have gazed upon [for ourselves] and have touched with our [own] hands.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30541" class="sup">2</span>And the Life [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30541b" title=" b">b</a>]</sup>an aspect of His being] was revealed (made manifest, demonstrated), and we saw [as eyewitnesses] and are testifying to and declare to you the Life, the eternal Life [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30541c" title=" c">c</a>]</sup>in Him] Who already existed with the Father and Who [actually] was made visible (was revealed) to us [His followers].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30542" class="sup">3</span>What we have seen and [ourselves] heard, we are also telling you, so that you too may <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30542d" title=" d">d</a>]</sup>realize and enjoy fellowship as partners and partakers with us. And [this] fellowship that we have [which is a <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30542e" title=" e">e</a>]</sup>distinguishing mark of Christians] is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ (the Messiah).<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30543" class="sup">4</span>And we are now writing these things to you so that our joy [in seeing you included] may be full [and <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30543f" title=" f">f</a>]</sup>your joy may be complete].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30544" class="sup">5</span>And this is the message [the message of <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30544g" title=" g">g</a>]</sup>promise] which we have heard from Him and now are reporting to you: God is Light, and there is no darkness in Him at all [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30544h" title=" h">h</a>]</sup>no, not in any way].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30545" class="sup">6</span>[So] if we say we are partakers together and enjoy fellowship with Him when we live and move and are walking about in darkness, we are [both] speaking falsely and do not live and practice the Truth [which the Gospel presents].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30546" class="sup">7</span>But if we [really] are living and walking in the Light, as He [Himself] is in the Light, we have [true, unbroken] fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses (removes) us from all sin and guilt [keeps us cleansed from sin in all its forms and manifestations].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30547" class="sup">8</span>If we say we have no sin [refusing to admit that we are sinners], we delude and lead ourselves astray, and the Truth [which the Gospel presents] is not in us [does not dwell in our hearts].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30548" class="sup">9</span>If we [freely] admit that we have sinned and confess our sins, He is faithful and just (true to His own nature and promises) and will forgive our sins [dismiss our lawlessness] and [continuously] cleanse us from all unrighteousness [everything not in conformity to His will in purpose, thought, and action].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30549" class="sup">10</span>If we say (claim) we have not sinned, we contradict His Word and make Him out to be false and a liar, and His Word is not in us [the divine message of the Gospel is not in our hearts].<p /> </p><p /><strong><br /><hr /><br /></strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-AMP-30540a"><a href="#en-AMP-30540" title="Go to 1 John 1:1">1 John 1:1</a> Marvin Vincent, Word Studies in the New Testament.</li>

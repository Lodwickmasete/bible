<p><h2>2 Peter 2</h2><span id="en-AMP-30500" class="sup">1</span>BUT ALSO [in those days] there arose false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among yourselves, who will subtly and stealthily introduce heretical doctrines (destructive heresies), even denying and disowning the Master Who bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30501" class="sup">2</span>And many will follow their immoral ways and lascivious doings; because of them the true Way will be maligned and defamed.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30502" class="sup">3</span>And in their covetousness (lust, greed) they will exploit you with false (cunning) arguments. From of old the sentence [of condemnation] for them has not been idle; their destruction (eternal misery) has not been asleep.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30503" class="sup">4</span>For God did not [even] spare angels that sinned, but cast them into hell, delivering them to be kept there in pits of gloom till the judgment and their doom.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30504" class="sup">5</span>And He spared not the ancient world, but preserved Noah, a preacher of righteousness, with seven other persons, when He brought a flood upon the world of ungodly [people].<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30504A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30505" class="sup">6</span>And He condemned to ruin and extinction the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, reducing them to ashes [and thus] set them forth as an example to those who would be ungodly;<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30505B" title="See cross-reference B">B</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30506" class="sup">7</span>And He rescued righteous Lot, greatly worn out and distressed by the wanton ways of the ungodly and lawless--<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30506C" title="See cross-reference C">C</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30507" class="sup">8</span>For that just man, living [there] among them, tortured his righteous soul every day with what he saw and heard of [their] unlawful and wicked deeds--<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30508" class="sup">9</span>Now if [all these things are true, then be sure] the Lord knows how to rescue the godly out of temptations and trials, and how to keep the ungodly under chastisement until the day of judgment and doom,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30509" class="sup">10</span>And particularly those who walk after the flesh and indulge in the lust of polluting passion and scorn and despise authority. Presumptuous [and] daring [self-willed and self-loving creatures]! They scoff at and revile dignitaries (glorious ones) without trembling,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30510" class="sup">11</span>Whereas [even] angels, though superior in might and power, do not bring a defaming charge against them before the Lord.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30511" class="sup">12</span>But these [people]! Like unreasoning beasts, mere creatures of instinct, born [only] to be captured and destroyed, railing at things of which they are ignorant, they shall utterly perish in their [own] corruption [in their destroying they shall surely be destroyed],<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30512" class="sup">13</span>Being destined to receive [punishment as] the reward of [their] unrighteousness [suffering wrong as the hire for their wrongdoing]. They count it a delight to revel in the daytime [living luxuriously and delicately]. They are blots and blemishes, reveling in their <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30512a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>deceptions and carousing together [even] as they feast with you.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30513" class="sup">14</span>They have eyes full of harlotry, insatiable for sin. They beguile and bait and lure away unstable souls. Their hearts are trained in covetousness (lust, greed), [they are] children of a curse [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30513b" title=" b">b</a>]</sup>exposed to cursing]!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30514" class="sup">15</span>Forsaking the straight road they have gone astray; they have followed the way of Balaam [the son] of Beor, who loved the reward of wickedness.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30514D" title="See cross-reference D">D</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30515" class="sup">16</span>But he was rebuked for his own transgression when a dumb beast of burden spoke with human voice and checked the prophet's madness.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30515E" title="See cross-reference E">E</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30516" class="sup">17</span>These are springs without water and mists driven along before a tempest, for whom is reserved forever the gloom of darkness.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30517" class="sup">18</span>For uttering loud boasts of folly, they beguile and lure with lustful desires of the flesh those who are barely escaping from them who are wrongdoers.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30518" class="sup">19</span>They promise them liberty, when they themselves are the slaves of depravity and defilement--for by whatever anyone is made inferior or worse or is overcome, to that [person or thing] he is enslaved.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30519" class="sup">20</span>For if, after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through [the full, personal] knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they again become entangled in them and are overcome, their last condition is worse [for them] than the first.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30520" class="sup">21</span>For never to have obtained a [full, personal] knowledge of the way of righteousness would have been better for them than, having obtained [such knowledge], to turn back from the holy commandment which was [verbally] delivered to them.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30521" class="sup">22</span>There has befallen them the thing spoken of in the true proverb, The dog turns back to his own vomit, and, The sow is washed only to wallow again in the mire.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30521F" title="See cross-reference F">F</a>)</sup><p /> </p><p /><strong><br /><hr /><br /></strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-AMP-30512a"><a href="#en-AMP-30512" title="Go to 2 Peter 2:13">2 Peter 2:13</a> Some ancient manuscripts read "love feasts."</li>

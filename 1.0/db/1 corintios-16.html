<p><h2>1 Corinthians 16</h2><span id="en-AMP-28776" class="sup">1</span>NOW CONCERNING the money contributed for [the relief of] the saints (God's people): you are to do the same as I directed the churches of Galatia to do.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28777" class="sup">2</span>On the first [day] of each week, let each one of you [personally] put aside something and save it up as he has prospered [in proportion to what he is given], so that no collections will need to be taken after I come.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28778" class="sup">3</span>And when I arrive, I will send on those whom you approve and authorize with credentials to carry your gift [of charity] to Jerusalem.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28779" class="sup">4</span>If it seems worthwhile that I should go too, they will accompany me.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28780" class="sup">5</span>After passing through Macedonia, I will visit you, for I intend [only] to pass through Macedonia;<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28781" class="sup">6</span>But it may be that I will stay with you [for a while], perhaps even spend the winter, so that you may bring me forward [on my journey] to wherever I may go.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28782" class="sup">7</span>For I am unwilling to see you right now [just] in passing, but I hope later to remain for some time with you, if the Lord permits.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28783" class="sup">8</span>I will remain in Ephesus [however] until Pentecost,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28784" class="sup">9</span>For a wide door of opportunity for effectual [service] has opened to me [there, a great and promising one], and [there are] many adversaries.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28785" class="sup">10</span>When Timothy arrives, see to it that [you put him at ease, so that] he may be fearless among you, for he is [devotedly] doing the Lord's work, just as I am.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28786" class="sup">11</span>So [see to it that] no one despises him or treats him as if he were of no account or slights him. But send him off [cordially, speed him on his way] in peace, that he may come to me, for I am expecting him [to come along] with the other brethren.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28787" class="sup">12</span>As for our brother Apollos, I have urgently encouraged him to visit you with the other brethren, but it was not at all his will or <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28787a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>God's will that he should go now. He will come when he has opportunity.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28788" class="sup">13</span>Be alert and on your guard; stand firm in your faith (<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28788b" title=" b">b</a>]</sup>your conviction respecting man's relationship to God and divine things, keeping the trust and holy fervor born of faith and a part of it). Act like men and be courageous; grow in strength!<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-28788A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-28789" class="sup">14</span>Let everything you do be done in love (true love to God and man as inspired by God's love for us).<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28790" class="sup">15</span>Now, brethren, you know that the household of Stephanas were the first converts and our firstfruits in Achaia (most of Greece), and how they have consecrated and devoted themselves to the service of the saints (God's people).<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28791" class="sup">16</span>I urge you to pay all deference to such leaders and to enlist under them and be subject to them, as well as to everyone who joins and cooperates [with you] and labors earnestly.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28792" class="sup">17</span>I am happy because Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus have come [to me], for they have made up for your absence.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28793" class="sup">18</span>For they gave me <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28793c" title=" c">c</a>]</sup>respite from labor and rested me and refreshed my spirit as well as yours. Deeply appreciate and thoroughly know and fully recognize such men.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28794" class="sup">19</span>The churches of Asia send greetings and best wishes. Aquila and Prisca, together with the church [that meets] in their house, send you their hearty greetings in the Lord.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28795" class="sup">20</span>All the brethren wish to be remembered to you and wish you well. Greet one another with a holy kiss.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28796" class="sup">21</span>I, Paul, [add this final] greeting with my own hand.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28797" class="sup">22</span>If anyone does not love the Lord [does not have a friendly affection for Him and is not kindly disposed toward Him], he shall be accursed! Our Lord will come! (Maranatha!)<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28798" class="sup">23</span>The grace (favor and spiritual blessing) of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28799" class="sup">24</span>My love (that true love growing out of sincere devotion to God) be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen (so be it). </p><p /><strong><br /><hr /><br /></strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-AMP-28787a"><a href="#en-AMP-28787" title="Go to 1 Corinthians 16:12">1 Corinthians 16:12</a> Although "his" may refer to Apollos, the probable reference here is to "God's will."</li>

<p><h2>1 Peter 4</h2><span id="en-AMP-30446" class="sup">1</span>SO, SINCE Christ suffered in the flesh <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30446a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>for us, for you, arm yourselves with the same thought and <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30446b" title=" b">b</a>]</sup>purpose [patiently to suffer rather than fail to please God]. For whoever has suffered in the flesh [having <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30446c" title=" c">c</a>]</sup>the mind of Christ] is done with [intentional] sin [has stopped pleasing himself and the world, and pleases God],<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30447" class="sup">2</span>So that he can no longer spend the rest of his natural life living by [his] human appetites and desires, but [he lives] for what God wills.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30448" class="sup">3</span>For the time that is past already suffices for doing what the Gentiles like to do--living [as you have done] in shameless, insolent wantonness, in lustful desires, drunkenness, reveling, drinking bouts and abominable, lawless idolatries.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30449" class="sup">4</span>They are astonished and think it very queer that you do not now run hand in hand with them in the same excesses of dissipation, and they abuse [you].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30450" class="sup">5</span>But they will have to give an account to Him Who is ready to judge and pass sentence on the living and the dead.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30451" class="sup">6</span>For this is why the good news (the Gospel) was preached [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30451d" title=" d">d</a>]</sup>in their lifetime] even to the dead, that though judged in fleshly bodies as men are, they might live in the spirit as God does.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30452" class="sup">7</span>But the end and culmination of all things has now come near; keep sound minded and self-restrained and alert therefore for [the practice of] prayer.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30453" class="sup">8</span>Above all things have intense and unfailing love for one another, for love covers a multitude of sins [forgives and <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30453e" title=" e">e</a>]</sup>disregards the offenses of others].<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30453A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30454" class="sup">9</span>Practice hospitality to one another (those of the household of faith). [Be hospitable, be a lover of strangers, with brotherly affection for the unknown guests, the foreigners, the poor, and all others who come your way who are of Christ's body.] And [in each instance] do it ungrudgingly (cordially and graciously, without complaining but as representing Him).<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30455" class="sup">10</span>As each of you has received a gift (a particular spiritual talent, a gracious divine endowment), employ it for one another as [befits] good trustees of God's many-sided grace [faithful stewards of the <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30455f" title=" f">f</a>]</sup>extremely diverse powers and gifts granted to Christians by unmerited favor].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30456" class="sup">11</span>Whoever speaks, [let him do it as one who utters] oracles of God; whoever renders service, [let him do it] as with the strength which God furnishes <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30456g" title=" g">g</a>]</sup>abundantly, so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ (the Messiah). To Him be the glory and dominion forever and ever (through endless ages). Amen (so be it).<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30457" class="sup">12</span>Beloved, do not be amazed and bewildered at the fiery ordeal which is taking place to test your quality, as though something strange (unusual and alien to you and your position) were befalling you.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30458" class="sup">13</span>But insofar as you are sharing Christ's sufferings, rejoice, so that when His glory [full of radiance and splendor] is revealed, you may also rejoice with triumph [exultantly].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30459" class="sup">14</span>If you are censured and suffer abuse [because you bear] the name of Christ, blessed [are you--happy, fortunate, <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30459h" title=" h">h</a>]</sup>to be envied, <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30459i" title=" i">i</a>]</sup>with life-joy, and satisfaction in God's favor and salvation, regardless of your outward condition], because the Spirit of glory, the Spirit of God, is resting upon you. On their part He is blasphemed, but on your part He is glorified.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30459B" title="See cross-reference B">B</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30460" class="sup">15</span>But let none of you suffer as a murderer or a thief or any sort of criminal, or as a mischief-maker (a meddler) in the affairs of others [infringing on their rights].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30461" class="sup">16</span>But if [one is ill-treated and suffers] as a Christian [which he is contemptuously called], let him not be ashamed, but give glory to God that he is [deemed worthy to suffer] in this name.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30462" class="sup">17</span>For the time [has arrived] for judgment to begin with the household of God; and if it begins with us, what will [be] the end of those who do not respect or believe or obey the good news (the Gospel) of God?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30463" class="sup">18</span>And if the righteous are barely saved, what will become of the godless and wicked?<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30463C" title="See cross-reference C">C</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30464" class="sup">19</span>Therefore, those who are ill-treated and suffer in accordance with God's will must do right and commit their souls [in charge as a deposit] to the One Who created [them] and will never fail [them].<p /> </p><p /><strong><br /><hr /><br /></strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-AMP-30446a"><a href="#en-AMP-30446" title="Go to 1 Peter 4:1">1 Peter 4:1</a> Some ancient manuscripts read "for us," while some "for you."</li>

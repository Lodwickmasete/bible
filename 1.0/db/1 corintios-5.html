<p><h2>1 Corinthians 5</h2><span id="en-AMP-28454" class="sup">1</span>IT IS actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, impurity of a sort that is condemned and does not occur even among the heathen; for a man has [his own] father's wife.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-28454A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-28455" class="sup">2</span>And you are proud and arrogant! And you ought rather to mourn (bow in sorrow and in shame) until the person who has done this [shameful] thing is removed from your fellowship and your midst!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28456" class="sup">3</span>As for my attitude, though I am absent [from you] in body, I am present in spirit, and I have already decided and passed judgment, as if actually present,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28457" class="sup">4</span>In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, on the man who has committed such a deed. When you and my own spirit are met together with the power of our Lord Jesus,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28458" class="sup">5</span>You are to deliver this man over to Satan <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28458a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>for physical discipline [to destroy carnal lusts which prompted him to incest], that [his] spirit may [yet] be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28459" class="sup">6</span>[About the condition of your church] your boasting is not good [indeed, it is most unseemly and entirely out of place]. Do you not know that [just] a little leaven will ferment the whole lump [of dough]?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28460" class="sup">7</span>Purge (clean out) the old leaven that you may be fresh (new) dough, still uncontaminated [as you are], for Christ, our Passover [Lamb], has been sacrificed.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28461" class="sup">8</span>Therefore, let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, nor with leaven of vice and malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened [bread] of purity (nobility, honor) and sincerity and [unadulterated] truth.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-28461B" title="See cross-reference B">B</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-28462" class="sup">9</span>I wrote you in my [previous] letter not to associate [closely and habitually] with unchaste (impure) people--<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28463" class="sup">10</span>Not [meaning of course that you must] altogether shun the immoral people of this world, or the greedy graspers and cheats and thieves or idolaters, since otherwise you would need to get out of the world and human society altogether!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28464" class="sup">11</span>But now I write to you not to associate with anyone who bears the name of [Christian] brother if he is known to be guilty of immorality or greed, or is an idolater [whose soul is devoted to any object that usurps the place of God], or is a person with a foul tongue [railing, abusing, reviling, slandering], or is a drunkard or a swindler or a robber. [No] you must not so much as eat with such a person.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28465" class="sup">12</span>What [business] of mine is it and what right have I to judge outsiders? Is it not those inside [the church] upon whom you are to pass disciplinary judgment [passing censuring sentence on them as the facts require]?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28466" class="sup">13</span>God alone sits in judgment on those who are outside. Drive out that wicked one from among you [expel him from your church].<p /> </p><p /><strong><br /><hr /><br /></strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-AMP-28458a"><a href="#en-AMP-28458" title="Go to 1 Corinthians 5:5">1 Corinthians 5:5</a> G.

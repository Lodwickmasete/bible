<p><h2>2 Chronicles 16</h2><span id="en-AMP-11511" class="sup">1</span>IN THE thirty-sixth year of Asa's reign, Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built (fortified) Ramah intending to intercept anyone going out or coming in to Asa king of Judah.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11512" class="sup">2</span>Then Asa brought silver and gold out of the treasuries of the house of the Lord and of the king's house and sent them to Ben-hadad king of Syria, who dwelt at Damascus, saying,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11513" class="sup">3</span>Let there be a league between me and you, as was between my father and your father. Behold, I am sending you silver and gold; go, break your league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may withdraw from me.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11514" class="sup">4</span>And Ben-hadad hearkened to King Asa and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, Dan, Abel-maim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11515" class="sup">5</span>And when Baasha heard it, he stopped building Ramah and let his work cease.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11516" class="sup">6</span>Then King Asa took all Judah, and they carried away the stones of Ramah and its timber with which Baasha had been building, and with them he built Geba and Mizpah.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11517" class="sup">7</span>At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah and said to him, Because you relied on the king of Syria and not on the Lord your God, the army of the king of Syria has escaped you.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11518" class="sup">8</span>Were not the Ethiopians and Libyans a huge host with very many chariots and horsemen? Yet because you relied then on the Lord, He gave them into your hand.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11519" class="sup">9</span>For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth to show Himself strong in behalf of those whose hearts are blameless toward Him. You have done foolishly in this; therefore, from now on you shall have wars.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11520" class="sup">10</span>Then Asa was angry with the seer and put him in prison [in the stocks], for he was enraged with him because of this. Asa oppressed some of the people at the same time.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11521" class="sup">11</span>The acts of Asa, from first to last, are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11522" class="sup">12</span>In the thirty-ninth year of his reign Asa was diseased in his feet--until his disease became very severe; yet in his disease he did not seek the Lord, but relied on the physicians.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11523" class="sup">13</span>And Asa slept with his fathers, dying in the forty-first year of his reign.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11524" class="sup">14</span>And they buried him in his own tomb which he had hewn out for himself in the City of David, and they laid him on a bier which was filled with sweet odors and various kinds [of spices] prepared by the perfumers' art; and they made a very great burning [of spices] in his honor.<p /> </p><p /><br /></div>

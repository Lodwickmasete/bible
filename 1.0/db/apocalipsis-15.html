<p><h2>Revelation 15</h2><span id="en-AMP-30947" class="sup">1</span>THEN I saw another wonder (sign, token, symbol) in heaven, great and marvelous [warning of events of ominous significance]: There were seven angels bringing seven plagues (afflictions, calamities), which are the last, for with them God's wrath (indignation) is completely expressed [reaches its climax and is ended].<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30947A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30948" class="sup">2</span>Then I saw what seemed to be a glassy sea blended with fire, and those who had come off victorious from the beast and from his statue and from the number corresponding to his name were standing beside the glassy sea, with harps of God in their hands.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30949" class="sup">3</span>And they sang the song of Moses the servant of God and the song of the Lamb, saying, Mighty and marvelous are Your works, O Lord God the Omnipotent! Righteous (just) and true are Your ways, O Sovereign of the ages (King of the <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30949a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>nations)!<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30949B" title="See cross-reference B">B</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30950" class="sup">4</span>Who shall not reverence and glorify Your name, O Lord [giving You honor and praise in worship]? For You only are holy. All the nations shall come and pay homage and adoration to You, for Your just judgments (Your righteous sentences and deeds) have been made known and displayed.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30950C" title="See cross-reference C">C</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30951" class="sup">5</span>After this I looked and the sanctuary of the tent of the testimony in heaven was thrown open,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30952" class="sup">6</span>And there came out of the temple sanctuary the seven angels bringing the seven plagues (afflictions, calamities). They were arrayed in pure gleaming linen, and around their breasts they wore golden girdles.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30953" class="sup">7</span>And one of the four living creatures [then] gave the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath and indignation of God, Who lives forever and ever (in the eternities of the eternities).<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30954" class="sup">8</span>And the sanctuary was filled with smoke from the glory (the radiance, the splendor) of God and from His might and power, and no one was able to go into the sanctuary until the seven plagues (afflictions, calamities) of the seven angels were ended.

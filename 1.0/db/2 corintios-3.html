<p><h2>2 Corinthians 3</h2><span id="en-AMP-28841" class="sup">1</span>ARE WE starting to commend ourselves again? Or we do not, like some [false teachers], need written credentials or letters of recommendation to you or from you, [do we]?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28842" class="sup">2</span>[No] you yourselves are our letter of recommendation (our credentials), written in <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28842a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>your hearts, to be known (perceived, recognized) and read by everybody.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28843" class="sup">3</span>You show and make obvious that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us, not written with ink but with [the] Spirit of [the] living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-28843A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-28844" class="sup">4</span>Such is the reliance and confidence that we have through Christ toward and with reference to God.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28845" class="sup">5</span>Not that we are fit (qualified and sufficient in ability) of ourselves to form personal judgments or to claim or count anything as coming from us, but our power and ability and sufficiency are from God.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28846" class="sup">6</span>[It is He] Who has qualified us [making us to be fit and worthy and sufficient] as ministers and dispensers of a new covenant [of salvation through Christ], not [ministers] of the letter (of legally written code) but of the Spirit; for the code [of the Law] kills, but the [Holy] Spirit makes alive.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-28846B" title="See cross-reference B">B</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-28847" class="sup">7</span>Now if the dispensation of death engraved in letters on stone [the ministration of the Law], was inaugurated with such glory and splendor that the Israelites were not able to look steadily at the face of Moses because of its brilliance, [a glory] that was to fade and pass away,<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-28847C" title="See cross-reference C">C</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-28848" class="sup">8</span>Why should not the dispensation of the Spirit [this spiritual <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28848b" title=" b">b</a>]</sup>ministry whose task it is to cause men to obtain and be governed by the Holy Spirit] be attended with much greater and more splendid glory?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28849" class="sup">9</span>For if the service that condemns [the ministration of doom] had glory, how infinitely more abounding in splendor and glory must be the service that makes righteous [the ministry that produces and fosters righteous living and right standing with God]!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28850" class="sup">10</span>Indeed, in view of this fact, what once had splendor [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28850c" title=" c">c</a>]</sup>the glory of the Law in the face of Moses] has come to have no splendor at all, because of the overwhelming glory that exceeds and excels it [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28850d" title=" d">d</a>]</sup>the glory of the Gospel in the face of Jesus Christ].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28851" class="sup">11</span>For if that which was but passing and fading away came with splendor, how much more must that which remains and is permanent abide in glory and splendor!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28852" class="sup">12</span>Since we have such [glorious] hope (such joyful and confident expectation), we speak very freely and openly and fearlessly.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28853" class="sup">13</span>Nor [do we act] like Moses, who put a veil over his face so that the Israelites might not gaze upon the finish of the vanishing [splendor which had been upon it].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28854" class="sup">14</span>In fact, their minds were grown hard and calloused [they had become dull and had lost the power of understanding]; for until this present day, when the Old Testament (the old covenant) is being read, that same veil still lies [on their hearts], not being lifted [to reveal] that in Christ it is made void and done away.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28855" class="sup">15</span>Yes, down to this [very] day whenever Moses is read, a veil lies upon their minds and hearts.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28856" class="sup">16</span>But whenever a person turns [in repentance] to the Lord, the veil is stripped off and taken away.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28857" class="sup">17</span>Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty (emancipation from bondage, freedom).<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-28857D" title="See cross-reference D">D</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-28858" class="sup">18</span>And all of us, as with unveiled face, [because we] continued to behold [in the Word of God] as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are constantly being transfigured into His very own image in ever increasing splendor and from one degree of glory to another; [for this comes] from the Lord [Who is] the Spirit.<p /> </p><p /><strong><br /><hr /><br /></strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-AMP-28842a"><a href="#en-AMP-28842" title="Go to 2 Corinthians 3:2">2 Corinthians 3:2</a> Many ancient manuscripts read "our."</li>

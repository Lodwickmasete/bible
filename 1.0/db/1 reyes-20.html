<p><h2>1 Kings 20</h2><span id="en-AMP-9410" class="sup">1</span>BEN-HADAD KING of Syria gathered all his army together; thirty-two kings were with him, and horses and chariots. And he went up and besieged Samaria, warring against it.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9411" class="sup">2</span>He sent messengers into Samaria to Ahab king of Israel and said to him, Thus says Ben-hadad:<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9412" class="sup">3</span>Your silver and your gold are mine; your wives and your children, even the fairest, also are mine.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9413" class="sup">4</span>And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king, according to what you say, I am yours, and all that I have.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9414" class="sup">5</span>The messengers came again and said, Thus says Ben-hadad: Although I have sent to you, saying, You shall deliver to me your silver, your gold, your wives, and your children--<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9415" class="sup">6</span>Yet I will send my servants to you tomorrow about this time, and they shall search your house and the houses of your servants; and all the desire of your eyes they shall lay hands upon and take it away.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9416" class="sup">7</span>Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land and said, Notice now and see how this man is seeking our destruction. He sent to me for my wives, my children, my silver, and my gold, and I did not refuse him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9417" class="sup">8</span>And all the elders and all the people said to him, Do not heed him or consent.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9418" class="sup">9</span>So he said to Ben-hadad's messengers, Tell my lord the king, All you first sent for to your servant I will do, but this thing I cannot do. And the messengers left; then they brought him word again.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9419" class="sup">10</span>Ben-hadad sent to him and said, May the gods do so to me, and more also, if the rubbish of Samaria shall be enough for each one of all the people who are at my feet and follow me to get a handful.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9420" class="sup">11</span>The king of Israel answered, Tell him: Let not him who girds on his harness boast as he who puts it off.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9421" class="sup">12</span>When Ben-hadad heard this message as he and the kings were drinking in the booths, he said to his servants, Set the army in array. And they set themselves in array against [Samaria].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9422" class="sup">13</span>Then a prophet came to Ahab king of Israel and said, Thus says the Lord: Have you seen all this great multitude? Behold, I will deliver it into your hand today, and you shall know and realize that I am the Lord.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9423" class="sup">14</span>Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus says the Lord: By the young men [the attendants or bodyguards] of the governors of the districts. Then Ahab said, Who shall order the battle? And he answered, You.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9424" class="sup">15</span>Ahab numbered the attendants of the governors of the districts, and they were 232. After them he numbered all the people of [the army of ] Israel, 7,000.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-9424A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-9425" class="sup">16</span>And they went out at noon. But Ben-hadad was drinking himself drunk in the booths, he and the thirty-two kings who helped him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9426" class="sup">17</span>The servants of the governors of the districts went out first; and Ben-hadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are men come out of Samaria.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9427" class="sup">18</span>And he said, Whether they have come out for peace or for war, take them alive.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9428" class="sup">19</span>So these [strong young guards] of the governors of the districts went out of [Samaria], and the army followed them.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9429" class="sup">20</span>And each one killed his man; the Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them. Ben-hadad king of Syria escaped on a horse with the horsemen.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9430" class="sup">21</span>The king of Israel went out and smote [the riders of] the horses and chariots and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9431" class="sup">22</span>The prophet came to the king of Israel and said to him, Go, fortify yourself and become strong and give attention to what you must do, for at the first of next year the king of Syria will return against you.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9432" class="sup">23</span>And the servants of the king of Syria said to him, Israel's gods are gods of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we. But let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9433" class="sup">24</span>And do this thing: Remove the kings, each from his place, and put governors in their stead.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9434" class="sup">25</span>And muster yourself an army like the army you have lost, horse for horse and chariot for chariot. And we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. And he heeded their speech and did so.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9435" class="sup">26</span>And at the return of the year, Ben-hadad mustered the Syrians and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9436" class="sup">27</span>The Israelites were counted and, all present, went against them. The Israelites encamped before the enemy like two little flocks of lost kids [absolutely everything against them but Almighty God], but the Syrians filled the country.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9437" class="sup">28</span>A man of God came and said to the king of Israel, Thus says the Lord: Because the Syrians have said, The Lord is God of the hills but He is not God of the valleys, therefore I will deliver all this great multitude into your hands, and you shall know and recognize by experience that I am the Lord.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-9437B" title="See cross-reference B">B</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-9438" class="sup">29</span>They encamped opposite each other seven days. Then the battle was joined; and the Israelites slew of the Syrians 100,000 foot soldiers in one day.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9439" class="sup">30</span>But the rest fled to the city of Aphek, and the wall fell upon 27,000 men who were left. Ben-hadad fled into the city and from chamber to chamber.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9440" class="sup">31</span>His servants said to him, We have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings. Let us put sackcloth on our loins and ropes about our necks, and go out to the king of Israel; perhaps he will spare your life.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9441" class="sup">32</span>So they girded sackcloth on their loins and put ropes on their necks, and came to the king of Israel and said, Your servant Ben-hadad says, I pray you, let me live. And King [Ahab] said, Is he yet alive? He is my brother.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9442" class="sup">33</span>Now the men took it as an omen and they hastily took it up and said, Yes, your brother Ben-hadad. Then the king said, Go, bring him. Then Ben-hadad came forth to him, and the victorious king caused him to come up into the chariot.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9443" class="sup">34</span>Ben-hadad [tempting him] said, The cities which my father took from your father I will restore; and you may maintain bazaars of your own in Damascus, as my father did in Samaria. Then, said Ahab, I will send you away on these terms. So he made a covenant with him and sent him away.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9444" class="sup">35</span>And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his neighbor, At the command of the Lord, strike me, I pray you. And the man refused to strike him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9445" class="sup">36</span>Then said he to him, Because you have not obeyed the voice of the Lord, behold, as soon as you have left me a lion will slay you. And as soon as he departed from him, a lion found him and killed him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9446" class="sup">37</span>Then [the prophet] found another man and said, Strike me, I pray you. And the man struck him, so that in striking, he wounded him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9447" class="sup">38</span>So the prophet departed and waited for King Ahab by the way, and disguised himself with ashes upon his face.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9448" class="sup">39</span>And as the king passed by, the [prophet] cried out to him, Your servant went out into the midst of the battle, and behold, a man turned aside and brought a man to me and said, Keep this man. If for any reason he is missing, then your life shall be required for his life, or else you shall pay a talent of silver.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9449" class="sup">40</span>But while your servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the king of Israel said to him, Such is your own verdict; you yourself have decided it.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9450" class="sup">41</span>The man hastily removed the ashes from his face, and Ahab king of Israel recognized him as one of the prophets.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9451" class="sup">42</span>And he said to the king, Thus says the Lord: Because you have let go out of your hand the man I had devoted to destruction, therefore your life shall go for his life, and your people for his people.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9452" class="sup">43</span>And King [Ahab] of Israel went to his house resentful and sullen, and came to Samaria.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-9452C" title="See cross-reference C">C</a>)</sup><p /> </p><p /><strong>Cross references:</strong><ol type="A"><li id="cen-AMP-9424A"><a href="#en-AMP-9424" title="Go to 1 Kings 20:15">1 Kings 20:15</a> :  Kings 19:18 </li>

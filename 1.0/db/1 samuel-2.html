<p><h2>1 Samuel 2</h2><span id="en-AMP-7242" class="sup">1</span>HANNAH PRAYED, and said, My heart exults and triumphs in the Lord; my horn (my strength) is lifted up in the Lord. My mouth is no longer silent, for it is opened wide over my enemies, because I rejoice in Your salvation.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7243" class="sup">2</span>There is none holy like the Lord, there is none besides You; there is no Rock like our God.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7244" class="sup">3</span>Talk no more so very proudly; let not arrogance go forth from your mouth, for the Lord is a God of knowledge, and by Him actions are weighed.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7245" class="sup">4</span>The bows of the mighty are broken, and those who stumbled are girded with strength.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7246" class="sup">5</span>Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread, but those who were hungry have ceased to hunger. The barren has borne seven, but she who has many children languishes and is forlorn.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7247" class="sup">6</span>The Lord slays and makes alive; He brings down to Sheol and raises up.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7248" class="sup">7</span>The Lord makes poor and makes rich; He brings low and He lifts up.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7249" class="sup">8</span>He raises up the poor out of the dust and lifts up the needy from the ash heap, to make them sit with nobles and inherit the throne of glory. For the pillars of the earth are the Lord's, and He has set the world upon them.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7250" class="sup">9</span>He will guard the feet of His godly ones, but the wicked shall be silenced and perish in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7251" class="sup">10</span>The adversaries of the Lord shall be broken to pieces; against them will He thunder in heaven. The Lord will judge [all peoples] to the ends of the earth; and He will give strength to <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-7251a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>His king (King) and exalt the power of His anointed (Anointed <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-7251b" title=" b">b</a>]</sup>His Christ).<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-7251A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-7252" class="sup">11</span>Elkanah and his wife Hannah returned to Ramah to his house. But the child ministered to the Lord before Eli the priest.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7253" class="sup">12</span>The sons of Eli were base and worthless; they did not know or regard the Lord.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7254" class="sup">13</span>And the custom of the priests with the people was this: when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came while the flesh was boiling with a fleshhook of three prongs in his hand;<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7255" class="sup">14</span>And he thrust it into the pan or kettle or caldron or pot; all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself. So they did in Shiloh with all the Israelites who came there.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7256" class="sup">15</span>Also, before they burned the fat, the priest's servant came and said to the man who sacrificed, Give the priest meat to roast, for he will not accept boiled meat from you, but raw.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7257" class="sup">16</span>And if the man said to him, Let them burn the fat first, and then you may take as much as you want, the priest's servant would say, No! Give it to me now or I will take it by force.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7258" class="sup">17</span>So the sin of the [two] young men was very great before the Lord, for they despised the offering of the Lord.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7259" class="sup">18</span>But Samuel ministered before the Lord, a child girded with a linen ephod.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7260" class="sup">19</span>Moreover, his mother made him a little robe and brought it to him from year to year when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7261" class="sup">20</span>And Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife and say, May the Lord give you children by this woman for the gift she asked for and gave to the Lord. Then they would go to their own home.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7262" class="sup">21</span>And the Lord visited Hannah, so that she bore three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before the Lord.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7263" class="sup">22</span>Now Eli was very old, and he heard all that his sons did to all Israel and how they lay with the women who served at the door of the Tent of Meeting.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7264" class="sup">23</span>And he said to them, Why do you do such things? For I hear of your evil dealings from all the people.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7265" class="sup">24</span>No, my sons; it is no good report which I hear the Lord's people spreading abroad.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7266" class="sup">25</span>If one man wrongs another, God will mediate for him; but if a man wrongs the Lord, who shall intercede for him? Yet they did not listen to their father, for it was the Lord's will to slay them.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7267" class="sup">26</span>Now the boy Samuel grew and was in favor both with the Lord and with men.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7268" class="sup">27</span>A man of God came to Eli and said to him, Thus has the Lord said: I plainly revealed Myself to the house of your father [forefather Aaron] when they were in Egypt in bondage to Pharaoh's house.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7269" class="sup">28</span>Moreover, I selected him out of all the tribes of Israel to be My priest, to offer on My altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before Me. And I gave [from then on] to the house of your father [forefather] all the offerings of the Israelites made by fire.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7270" class="sup">29</span>Why then do you kick [trample upon, treat with contempt] My sacrifice and My offering which I commanded, and honor your sons above Me by fattening yourselves upon the choicest part of every offering of My people Israel?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7271" class="sup">30</span>Therefore the Lord, the God of Israel, says, I did promise that your house and that of your father [forefather Aaron] should go in and out before Me forever. But now the Lord says, Be it far from Me. For those who honor Me I will honor, and those who despise Me shall be lightly esteemed.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7272" class="sup">31</span>Behold, the time is coming when I will cut off your strength and the strength of your own father's house, that there shall not be an old man in your house.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7273" class="sup">32</span>And you shall behold the distress of My house, even in all the prosperity which God will give Israel, and there shall not be an old man in your house forever.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7274" class="sup">33</span>Yet I will not cut off from My altar every man of yours; some shall survive to weep and mourn [over the family's ruin], but all the increase of your house shall die in their best years.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-7274B" title="See cross-reference B">B</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-7275" class="sup">34</span>And what befalls your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, shall be a sign to you--in one day they both shall die. [Fulfilled in I Sam. 4:17, 18.]<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7276" class="sup">35</span>And I will raise up for Myself a <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-7276c" title=" c">c</a>]</sup>faithful priest (Priest), who shall do according to what is in My heart and mind.

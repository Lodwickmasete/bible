<p><h2>1 Samuel 31</h2><span id="en-AMP-8011" class="sup">1</span>NOW THE Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled before [them] and fell slain on Mount Gilboa.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8012" class="sup">2</span>And the Philistines pursued Saul and his sons, and slew Jonathan and Abinadab and Malchi-shua, Saul's sons.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8013" class="sup">3</span>The battle went heavily against Saul, and the archers severely wounded him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8014" class="sup">4</span>Saul said to his armor-bearer, Draw your sword and thrust me through, lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through and abuse and mock me. But his armor-bearer would not, for he was terrified.

His story was probably a fabrication. He found the king's body on the battlefield, stripped it, and brought the spoil to David hoping for a reward, as The Cambridge Bible comments. However, it is possible that Saul was not entirely dead when the Amalekite found him, though his armor-bearer had thought him dead and had killed himself, in which case the Amalekite's story may have been true.</li>

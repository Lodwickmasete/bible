<p><h2>Amos 8</h2><span id="en-AMP-22483" class="sup">1</span>THUS THE Lord God showed to me, and behold, a basket of [ripe and therefore soon to perish] summer fruit.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-22484" class="sup">2</span>And He said, Amos, what do you see? And I said, A basket of summer fruit. Then said the Lord to me, The end has come upon My people Israel; I will not pass by and spare them any more.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-22485" class="sup">3</span>And the songs of the temple shall become wailings in that day, says the Lord God. The dead bodies shall be many; in every place they shall be cast forth in silence.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-22486" class="sup">4</span>Hear this, O you who would swallow up and trample down the needy, even to make the poor of the land to fail and come to an end,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-22487" class="sup">5</span>Saying, When will the New Moon festival be past that we may sell grain? And the Sabbath that we may offer wheat for sale, making the ephah [measure] small and the shekel [measure] great and falsifying the scales by deceit,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-22488" class="sup">6</span>That we may buy [into slavery] the poor for silver and the needy for a pair of sandals; yes, and sell the refuse of the wheat [as if it were good grade]?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-22489" class="sup">7</span>The Lord has sworn by [Himself Who is] the Glory and Pride of Jacob, Surely I will never forget any of their [rebellious] deeds.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-22490" class="sup">8</span>Shall not the land tremble on this account, and everyone mourn who dwells in it? Yes, it shall rise like the river [Nile], all of it, and it shall be tossed about and sink back again to normal level, as does the Nile of Egypt.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-22491" class="sup">9</span>And in that day, says the Lord God, I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in the broad daylight.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-22491A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-22492" class="sup">10</span>And I will turn your feasts into mourning and all your songs into lamentation, and I will cause sackcloth to be put upon all loins and baldness [for mourning] shall come on every head; and I will make that time as the mourning for an only son, and the end of it as a bitter day.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-22493" class="sup">11</span>Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord God, when I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but [a famine] for hearing the words of the Lord.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-22494" class="sup">12</span>And [the people] shall wander from sea to sea and from the north even to the east; they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord [inquiring for and requiring it as one requires food], but shall not find it.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-22495" class="sup">13</span>In that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-22496" class="sup">14</span>Those who swear by Ashimah or the sin of Samaria and say, By the life of your god [the golden calf], O Dan! and [swear], By the life of the way of [idolatrous] Beersheba, they shall fall and rise no more.<p /> </p><p /><strong>Cross references:</strong><ol type="A"><li id="cen-AMP-22491A"><a href="#en-AMP-22491" title="Go to Amos 8:9">Amos 8:9</a> : zek 32:7-10 </li>

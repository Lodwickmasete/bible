<p><h2>1 Kings 5</h2><span id="en-AMP-8880" class="sup">1</span>HIRAM KING of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon, when he heard that he was anointed king in place of his father, for Hiram always loved David.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8881" class="sup">2</span>And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8882" class="sup">3</span>You know how David my father could not build a house to the Name of the Lord his God because wars were about him on every side, until the Lord put his foes under his feet.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-8882A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-8883" class="sup">4</span>But now the Lord my God has given me rest on every side, so that there is neither adversary nor evil confronting me.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8884" class="sup">5</span>And I purpose to build a house to the Name of the Lord my God, as the Lord said to David my father, Your son whom I will set on your throne in your place shall build the house to My Name and Presence.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8885" class="sup">6</span>So, Hiram, command them to hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon; my servants shall join yours, and I will give you whatever wages you set for your servants. For you know that no one among us can equal the skill of the Sidon men in cutting timber.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8886" class="sup">7</span>When Hiram heard the words of Solomon, he rejoiced greatly and said, Blessed be the Lord this day, Who has given David a wise son to be over this great people.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8887" class="sup">8</span>And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things for which you sent to me; I will do all you wish concerning the cedar and cypress timber.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8888" class="sup">9</span>My servants shall bring the logs down from Lebanon to the sea, make them into rafts, and float them by sea to the place that you direct. I will have them released there, and you shall take them away.

It is the chief cornerstone of the Mosque of Omar's massive wall, placed in its present position 3,000 years ago. Markings on the stones represent the culture of Phoenicia, the region around Tyre from which Solomon received building materials for the temple.</li>

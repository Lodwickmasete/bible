<p><h2>Revelation 7</h2><span id="en-AMP-30811" class="sup">1</span>AFTER THIS I saw four angels stationed at the four corners of the earth, <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30811a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>firmly holding back the four winds of the earth so that no wind should blow on the earth or sea or upon any tree.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30811A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30812" class="sup">2</span>Then I saw a second angel coming up from the east (the rising of the sun) and carrying the seal of the living God. And with a loud voice he called out to the four angels who had been given authority and power to injure earth and sea,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30813" class="sup">3</span>Saying, Harm neither the earth nor the sea nor the trees, until we have sealed the bond servants of our God upon their foreheads.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30813B" title="See cross-reference B">B</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30814" class="sup">4</span>And [then] I heard how many were sealed (marked) out of every tribe of the sons of Israel: there were 144,000.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30815" class="sup">5</span>Twelve thousand were sealed (marked) out of the tribe of Judah, 12,000 of the tribe of Reuben, 12,000 of the tribe of Gad,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30816" class="sup">6</span>Twelve thousand of the tribe of Asher, 12,000 of the tribe of Naphtali, 12,000 of the tribe of Manasseh,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30817" class="sup">7</span>Twelve thousand of the tribe of Simeon, 12,000 of the tribe of Levi, 12,000 of the tribe of Issachar,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30818" class="sup">8</span>Twelve thousand of the tribe of Zebulun, 12,000 of the tribe of Joseph, 12,000 of the tribe of Benjamin.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30819" class="sup">9</span>After this I looked and a vast host appeared which no one could count, [gathered out] of every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages. These stood before the throne and before the Lamb; they were attired in white robes, with palm branches in their hands.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30820" class="sup">10</span>In loud voice they cried, saying, [Our] salvation is due to our God, Who is seated on the throne, and to the Lamb [to Them we owe our deliverance]!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30821" class="sup">11</span>And all the angels were standing round the throne and round the elders [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30821b" title=" b">b</a>]</sup>of the heavenly Sanhedrin] and the four living creatures, and they fell prostrate before the throne and worshiped God.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30822" class="sup">12</span>Amen! (So be it!) they cried. Blessing and glory and majesty and splendor and wisdom and thanks and honor and power and might [be ascribed] to our God to the ages and ages (forever and ever, throughout the eternities of the eternities)! Amen! (So be it!)<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30823" class="sup">13</span>Then, addressing me, one of the elders [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30823c" title=" c">c</a>]</sup>of the heavenly Sanhedrin] said, Who are these [people] clothed in the long white robes? And from where have they come?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30824" class="sup">14</span>I replied, Sir, you know. And he said to me, These are they who have come out of the great tribulation (persecution), and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30824C" title="See cross-reference C">C</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30825" class="sup">15</span>For this reason they are [now] before the [very] throne of God and serve Him day and night in His sanctuary (temple); and He Who is sitting upon the throne will protect and spread His tabernacle over and shelter them with His presence.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30826" class="sup">16</span>They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun smite them, nor any <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30826d" title=" d">d</a>]</sup>scorching heat.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30826D" title="See cross-reference D">D</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30827" class="sup">17</span>For the Lamb Who is in the midst of the throne will be their Shepherd, and He will guide them to the springs of the waters of life; and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30827E" title="See cross-reference E">E</a>)</sup><p /> </p><p /><strong><br /><hr /><br /></strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-AMP-30811a"><a href="#en-AMP-30811" title="Go to Revelation 7:1">Revelation 7:1</a> Marvin Vincent, Word Studies.</li>

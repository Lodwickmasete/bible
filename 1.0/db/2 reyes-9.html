<p><h2>2 Kings 9</h2><span id="en-AMP-9758" class="sup">1</span>AND ELISHA the prophet called one of the sons of the prophets and said to him, Gird up your loins, take this flask of oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth-gilead.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9759" class="sup">2</span>When you arrive, look there for Jehu son of Jehoshaphat son of Nimshi; and go in and have him arise from among his brethren and lead him to an inner chamber.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9760" class="sup">3</span>Then take the cruse of oil and pour it on his head and say, Thus says the Lord: I have anointed you king over Israel. Then open the door and flee; do not tarry.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9761" class="sup">4</span>So the young man, the young prophet, went to Ramoth-gilead.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9762" class="sup">5</span>And when he came, the captains of the army were sitting outside; and he said, I have a message for you, O captain. Jehu said, To which of us? And he said, To you, O captain.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9763" class="sup">6</span>And Jehu arose, and they went into the house. And the prophet poured the oil on Jehu's head and said to him, Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: I have anointed you king over the people of the Lord, even over Israel.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9764" class="sup">7</span>You shall strike down the house of Ahab your master, that I may avenge the blood of My servants the prophets and of all the servants of the Lord [who have died] at the hands of Jezebel.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9765" class="sup">8</span>For the whole house of Ahab shall perish, and I will cut off from Ahab every male, bond or free, in Israel.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9766" class="sup">9</span>I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat and like the house of Baasha son of Ahijah.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-9766A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-9767" class="sup">10</span>And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and none shall bury her. And he opened the door and fled. [Fulfilled in II Kings 9:33-37.]<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9768" class="sup">11</span>When Jehu came out to the servants of his master, one said to him, Is all well? Why did this mad fellow come to you? And he said to them, You know that class of man and what he would say.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9769" class="sup">12</span>And they said, That is false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus he spoke to me, saying, Thus says the Lord: I have anointed you king over Israel.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9770" class="sup">13</span>Then they hastily took every man his garment and put it [for a cushion] under Jehu on the top of the [outside] stairs, and blew with trumpets, saying, Jehu is king!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9771" class="sup">14</span>So Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, conspired against Joram [to dethrone and slay him]. Now Joram was holding Ramoth-gilead, he and all Israel, against Hazael king of Syria,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9772" class="sup">15</span>But King Joram had returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him when he fought with Hazael king of Syria. And Jehu said, If this is your mind, let no one make his escape from the city [Ramoth-gilead] to go and tell it in Jezreel [the capital].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9773" class="sup">16</span>So Jehu rode in a chariot and went to Jezreel, for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah king of Judah had come down to see Joram.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9774" class="sup">17</span>A watchman on the tower in Jezreel spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Send a horseman to meet them and have him ask, Do you come in peace?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9775" class="sup">18</span>So one on horseback went to meet him and said, Thus says the king: Is it peace? And Jehu said, What have you to do with peace? Rein in behind me. And the watchman reported, The messenger came to them, but he does not return.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9776" class="sup">19</span>Then Joram sent out a second man on horseback, who came to them and said, Thus says the king: Is it peace? Jehu replied, What have you to do with peace? Ride behind me.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9777" class="sup">20</span>And the watchman reported, He came to them, but does not return; also the driving is like the driving of Jehu son of Nimshi, for he drives furiously.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9778" class="sup">21</span>Joram said, Make ready. When his chariot was made ready, Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot. Thus they went out to meet Jehu and met him in the field of Naboth the Jezreelite.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9779" class="sup">22</span>When Joram saw Jehu, he said, Is it peace, Jehu? And he answered, How can peace exist as long as the fornications of your mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9780" class="sup">23</span>Then Joram reined about and fled, and he said to Ahaziah, Treachery, Ahaziah!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9781" class="sup">24</span>But Jehu drew his bow with his full strength and shot Joram between his shoulders; and the arrow went out through his heart, and he sank down in his chariot.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9782" class="sup">25</span>Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take [Joram] up and cast him in the plot of Naboth the Jezreelite's field; for remember how, when I and you rode together after Ahab his father, the Lord uttered this prophecy against him:<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9783" class="sup">26</span>As surely as I saw yesterday the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons, says the Lord, I will repay you on this plot of ground, says the Lord. Now therefore, take and cast Joram into the plot of ground [of Naboth], as the word of the Lord said.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-9783B" title="See cross-reference B">B</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-9784" class="sup">27</span>When Ahaziah king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. Jehu followed him and said, Smite him also in the chariot. And they did so at the ascent to Gur, which is by Ibleam. And [Ahaziah] fled to Megiddo and died there.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9785" class="sup">28</span>His servants took him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulcher with his fathers in the City of David.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9786" class="sup">29</span>In the eleventh year of Joram son of Ahab, Ahaziah's reign over Judah began.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9787" class="sup">30</span>Now when Jehu came to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it, and she painted her eyes and beautified her head and looked out of [an upper] window.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9788" class="sup">31</span>And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, [Have you come in] peace, you Zimri, who slew his master?<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-9788C" title="See cross-reference C">C</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-9789" class="sup">32</span>Jehu lifted up his face to the window and said, Who is on my side? Who? And two or three eunuchs looked out at him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9790" class="sup">33</span>And he said, Throw her down! So they threw her down, and some of her blood splattered on the wall and on the horses, and he drove over her.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9791" class="sup">34</span>When he came in, he ate and drank, and said, See now to this cursed woman and bury her, for she is a king's daughter.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9792" class="sup">35</span>They went to bury her, but they found nothing left of her except the skull, feet, and palms of her hands.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9793" class="sup">36</span>They came again and told Jehu. He said, This is the word of the Lord which He spoke by His servant Elijah the Tishbite, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-9793D" title="See cross-reference D">D</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-9794" class="sup">37</span>The corpse of Jezebel shall be like dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel, so that they shall not say, This is Jezebel.<p /> </p><p /><strong>Cross references:</strong><ol type="A"><li id="cen-AMP-9766A"><a href="#en-AMP-9766" title="Go to 2 Kings 9:9">2 Kings 9:9</a> :  Kings 21:22 </li>

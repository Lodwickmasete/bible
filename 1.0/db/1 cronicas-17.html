<p><h2>1 Chronicles 17</h2><span id="en-AMP-10865" class="sup">1</span>AS DAVID sat in his house, he said to Nathan the prophet, Behold, I dwell in a house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of the Lord remains under tent curtains.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10866" class="sup">2</span>Then Nathan said to David, Do all that is in your heart, for God is with you.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10867" class="sup">3</span>And that same night the word of God came to Nathan, saying,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10868" class="sup">4</span>Go and tell David My servant, Thus says the Lord: You shall not build Me a house to dwell in,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10869" class="sup">5</span>For I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel from Egypt until this day; but I have gone from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to another.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10870" class="sup">6</span>Wherever I have walked with all Israel, did I say a word to any of the judges of Israel whom I commanded to feed My people, saying, Why have you not built Me a house of cedar?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10871" class="sup">7</span>Now therefore, thus shall you say to My servant David, Thus says the Lord of hosts: I took you from the sheepfold, from following the sheep, that you should be prince over My people Israel.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10872" class="sup">8</span>And I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have cut off all your enemies from before you, and I will make your name like the name of the great ones of the earth.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10873" class="sup">9</span>Also I will appoint a place for My people Israel and will plant them, that they may dwell in their own place and be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the first,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10874" class="sup">10</span>Since the time that I commanded judges to be over My people Israel. Moreover, I will subdue all your enemies. Furthermore, I foretell to you that the Lord will build you a house (a blessed posterity).<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10875" class="sup">11</span>And it shall come to pass that when your days are fulfilled to go to be with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, one of your own sons, and I will establish his kingdom.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10876" class="sup">12</span>He shall build Me a house, and I will establish his throne forever.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-10876A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-10877" class="sup">13</span>I will be his father, and he shall be My son; and I will not take My mercy and steadfast love away from him, as I took it from him [King Saul] who was before you.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-10877B" title="See cross-reference B">B</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-10878" class="sup">14</span>But I will settle <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-10878a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>him (Him) in My house and in My kingdom forever; and his (His) throne shall be established forevermore.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-10878C" title="See cross-reference C">C</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-10879" class="sup">15</span>According to all these words and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10880" class="sup">16</span>And David the king went in and sat before the Lord and said, Who am I, O Lord God, and what is my house and family, that You have brought me up to this?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10881" class="sup">17</span>And yet this was a small thing in Your eyes, O God; for You have spoken of Your servant's house for a great while to come, and have regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O Lord God!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10882" class="sup">18</span>What more can David say to You for thus honoring Your servant? For You know Your servant.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10883" class="sup">19</span>O Lord, for Your servant's sake and in accord with Your own heart, You have wrought all this greatness, to make known all these great things.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10884" class="sup">20</span>O Lord, there is none like You, nor is there any God beside You, according to all that our ears have heard.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10885" class="sup">21</span>And what nation on the earth is like Your people Israel, whom God went to redeem to Himself as a people, making Yourself a name by great and terrible things, by driving out nations from before Your people, whom You redeemed out of Egypt?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10886" class="sup">22</span>You made Your people Israel Your own forever, and You, Lord, became their God.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10887" class="sup">23</span>Therefore now, Lord, let the word which You have spoken concerning Your servant and his house be established forever, and do as You have said.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10888" class="sup">24</span>Let it be established and let Your name [and the character that name denotes] be magnified forever, saying, The Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, is Israel's God; and the house of David Your servant will be established before You.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10889" class="sup">25</span>For You, O my God, have told Your servant that You will build for him a house (a blessed posterity); therefore Your servant has found courage and confidence to pray before You.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10890" class="sup">26</span>And now, Lord, You are God, and have promised this good thing to Your servant.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10891" class="sup">27</span>Therefore may it please You to bless the house (posterity) of Your servant, that it may continue before You forever; for what You bless, O Lord, is blessed forever.<p /> </p><p /><strong><br /><hr /><br /></strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-AMP-10878a"><a href="#en-AMP-10878" title="Go to 1 Chronicles 17:14">1 Chronicles 17:14</a> The "house" or "kingdom of God," in which this preservation or confirming of the seed of David is to take place, has two points of reference: first, the Old Testament theocracy [government of a state by the immediate direction of God], and second, the Messianic kingdom of the new covenant. The text of II Sam. 7:16 (KJV) differs: "And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established forever before thee, and thy throne shall be established forever." The sense of both is Messianic [though the writer in earlier verses definitely referred not to Christ but to Solomon (I Chron. 17:11-13 and II Sam. 7:13, 14)] (J.P. Lange, A Commentary). "The reference in this prophecy looks beyond Solomon to Him of Whom the greatest princes of the house of David were but imperfect types" (Charles Ellicott, A Bible Commentary).</li>

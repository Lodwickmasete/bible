<p><h2>2 Corinthians 7</h2><span id="en-AMP-28916" class="sup">1</span>THEREFORE, SINCE these [great] promises are ours, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from everything that contaminates and defiles body and spirit, and bring [our] consecration to completeness in the [reverential] fear of God.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28917" class="sup">2</span>Do open your hearts to us again [enlarge them to take us in]. We have wronged no one, we have betrayed or corrupted no one, we have cheated or taken advantage of no one.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28918" class="sup">3</span>I do not say this to reproach or condemn [you], for I have said before that you are [nested] in our hearts, [and you will remain there] together [with us], whether we die or live.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28919" class="sup">4</span>I have great boldness and free and fearless confidence and cheerful courage toward you; my pride in you is great. I am filled [brimful] with the comfort [of it]; with all our tribulation and in spite of it, [I am filled with comfort] I am overflowing with joy.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28920" class="sup">5</span>For even when we arrived in Macedonia, our bodies had no ease or rest, but we were oppressed in every way and afflicted at every turn--fighting and contentions without, dread and fears within [us].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28921" class="sup">6</span>But God, Who comforts and encourages and refreshes and cheers the depressed and the sinking, comforted and encouraged and refreshed and cheered us by the arrival of Titus.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28922" class="sup">7</span>[Yes] and not only by his coming but also by [his account of] the comfort with which he was encouraged and refreshed and cheered as to you, while he told us of your yearning affection, of how sorry you were [for me] and how eagerly you took my part, so that I rejoiced still more.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28923" class="sup">8</span>For even though I did grieve you with my letter, I do not regret [it now], though I did regret it; for I see that that letter did pain you, though only for a little while;<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28924" class="sup">9</span>Yet I am glad now, not because you were pained, but because you were pained into repentance [and so turned back to God]; for you felt a grief such as God meant you to feel, so that in nothing you might suffer loss through us or harm for what we did.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28925" class="sup">10</span>For godly grief and the pain God is permitted to direct, produce a repentance that leads and contributes to salvation and deliverance from evil, and it never brings regret; but worldly grief (the hopeless sorrow that is characteristic of the pagan world) is deadly [breeding and ending in death].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28926" class="sup">11</span>For [you can look back now and] observe what this same godly sorrow has done for you and has produced in you: what eagerness and earnest care to explain and clear yourselves [of all <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28926a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>complicity in the condoning of incest], what indignation [at the sin], what alarm, what yearning, what zeal [to do justice to all concerned], what readiness to mete out punishment [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28926b" title=" b">b</a>]</sup>to the offender]! At every point you have proved yourselves cleared and guiltless in the matter. [I Cor. 5.]<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28927" class="sup">12</span>So although I did write to you [as I did], it was not for the sake and because of the one who did [the] wrong, nor on account of the one who suffered [the] wrong, but in order that you might realize before God [that your readiness to accept our authority revealed] how zealously you do care for us.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28928" class="sup">13</span>Therefore we are relieved and comforted and encouraged [at the result]. And in addition to our own [personal] consolation, we were especially delighted at the joy of Titus, because you have all set his mind at rest, soothing and refreshing his spirit.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28929" class="sup">14</span>For if I had boasted to him at all concerning you, I was not disappointed or put to shame, but just as everything we ever said to you was true, so our boasting [about you] to Titus has proved true also.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28930" class="sup">15</span>And his heart goes out to you more abundantly than ever as he recalls the submission [to his guidance] that all of you had, and the reverence and anxiety [to meet all requirements] with which you accepted and welcomed him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28931" class="sup">16</span>I am very happy because I now am of good courage and have perfect confidence in you in all things.<p /> </p><p /><strong><br /><hr /><br /></strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-AMP-28926a"><a href="#en-AMP-28926" title="Go to 2 Corinthians 7:11">2 Corinthians 7:11</a> Marvin Vincent, Word Studies.</li>

<p><h2>1 Chronicles 5</h2><span id="en-AMP-10430" class="sup">1</span>NOW [we come to] the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel. For [Reuben] was the eldest, but because he polluted his father's couch [with Bilhah his father's concubine] his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph [favorite] son of Israel; so the genealogy is not to be reckoned according to the birthright.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-10430A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-10431" class="sup">2</span>Judah prevailed above his brethren, and from him came the prince and leader [and eventually the Messiah]; yet the birthright was Joseph's.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-10431B" title="See cross-reference B">B</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-10432" class="sup">3</span>The sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10433" class="sup">4</span>The sons of Joel: Shemaiah his son, Gog his son, Shimei his son,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10434" class="sup">5</span>Micah his son, Reaiah his son, Baal his son,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10435" class="sup">6</span>Beerah his son, whom Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria carried away captive; he was a prince of the Reubenites.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10436" class="sup">7</span>And his brethren by their families, when the genealogy of their generations was reckoned: the chief Jeiel, and Zechariah,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10437" class="sup">8</span>Bela son of Azaz, the son of Shema, the son of Joel, who dwelt in Aroer as far as Nebo and Baal-meon.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10438" class="sup">9</span>Eastward [Bela] inhabited the land as far as the entrance into the desert this [west] side of the river Euphrates, because their cattle had multiplied in the land of Gilead.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10439" class="sup">10</span>In the days of [King] Saul they made war with the Hagrites or Ishmaelites, who fell by their hands; they dwelt in their tents in all the land east of Gilead.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10440" class="sup">11</span>The children of Gad who dwelt opposite them in the land of Bashan, as far as Salecah:<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10441" class="sup">12</span>Joel the chief, Shapham the next, Janai, and Shaphat in Bashan.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10442" class="sup">13</span>Their kinsmen of the houses of their fathers: Michael, Meshullam, Sheba, Jorai, Jacan, Zia, and Eber--seven in all.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10443" class="sup">14</span>These were the sons of Abihail son of Huri, the son of Jaroah, the son of Gilead, the son of Michael, the son of Jeshishai, the son of Jahdo, the son of Buz.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10444" class="sup">15</span>Ahi son of Abdiel, the son of Guni, was chief in their fathers' houses.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10445" class="sup">16</span>They dwelt in Gilead, in Bashan and in its towns, and in all the suburbs and pasturelands of Sharon to their limits.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10446" class="sup">17</span>All these were enrolled by genealogies in the days of Jotham king of Judah and in the days of Jeroboam [II] king of Israel.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10447" class="sup">18</span>The sons of Reuben, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh--valiant men able to bear buckler and sword and to shoot with bow and skillful in war--were 44,760 able and ready to go forth to war.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10448" class="sup">19</span>And [these Israelites, on the east side of the Jordan River] made war with the Hagrites [a tribe of northern Arabia], Jetur, Naphish, and Nodab.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10449" class="sup">20</span>They were given help against them, and the Hagrites or Ishmaelites were delivered into their hands, and all who were allied with them, for they cried to God in the battle; and He granted their entreaty, because they relied on, clung to, and trusted in Him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10450" class="sup">21</span>And [these Israelites] took away their adversaries' herds: of their camels 50,000, and of sheep 250,000, and of donkeys 2,000, and of the lives of men 100,000.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10451" class="sup">22</span>For a great number fell mortally wounded, because the battle was God's.

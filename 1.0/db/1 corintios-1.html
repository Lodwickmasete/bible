<p><h2>1 Corinthians 1</h2><span id="en-AMP-28363" class="sup">1</span>PAUL, SUMMONED by the will and purpose of God to be an apostle (special messenger) of Christ Jesus, and our brother Sosthenes,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28364" class="sup">2</span>To the church (assembly) of God which is in Corinth, to those consecrated and purified and made holy in Christ Jesus, [who are] selected and called to be saints (God's people), together with all those who in any place call upon and give honor to the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both their Lord and ours:<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28365" class="sup">3</span>Grace (favor and spiritual blessing) be to you and [heart] peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28366" class="sup">4</span>I thank my God at all times for you because of the grace (the favor and spiritual blessing) of God which was bestowed on you in Christ Jesus,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28367" class="sup">5</span>[So] that in Him in every respect you were enriched, in full power and readiness of speech [to speak of your faith] and complete knowledge and illumination [to give you full insight into its meaning].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28368" class="sup">6</span>In this way [our] witnessing concerning Christ (the Messiah) was so confirmed and established and made sure in you<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28369" class="sup">7</span>That you are not [consciously] falling behind or lacking in any special spiritual endowment or Christian grace [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28369a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>the reception of which is due to the power of divine grace operating in your souls by the Holy Spirit], while you wait and watch [constantly living in hope] for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and [His] being made visible to all.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28370" class="sup">8</span>And He will establish you to the end [keep you steadfast, give you strength, and guarantee your vindication; He will be your warrant against all accusation or indictment so that you will be] guiltless and irreproachable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah).<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28371" class="sup">9</span>God is faithful (reliable, trustworthy, and therefore ever true to His promise, and He can be depended on); by Him you were called into companionship and participation with His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28372" class="sup">10</span>But I urge and entreat you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you be in perfect harmony and full agreement in what you say, and that there be no dissensions or factions or divisions among you, but that you be perfectly united in your common understanding and in your opinions and judgments.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28373" class="sup">11</span>For it has been made clear to me, my brethren, by those of Chloe's household, that there are contentions and wrangling and factions among you.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28374" class="sup">12</span>What I mean is this, that each one of you [either] says, I belong to Paul, or I belong to Apollos, or I belong to Cephas (Peter), or I belong to Christ.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28375" class="sup">13</span>Is Christ (the Messiah) divided into parts? Was Paul crucified on behalf of you? Or were you baptized into the name of Paul?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28376" class="sup">14</span>I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28377" class="sup">15</span>Lest anyone should say that I baptized in my own name.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28378" class="sup">16</span>[Yes] I did baptize the household of Stephanas also. More than these, I do not remember that I baptized anyone.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28379" class="sup">17</span>For Christ (the Messiah) sent me out not to baptize but [to evangelize by] preaching the glad tidings (the Gospel), and that not with verbal eloquence, lest the cross of Christ should be deprived of force and emptied of its power and rendered vain (fruitless, void of value, and of no effect).<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28380" class="sup">18</span>For the story and message of the cross is sheer absurdity and folly to those who are perishing and on their way to perdition, but to us who are being saved it is the [manifestation of] the power of God.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28381" class="sup">19</span>For it is written, I will baffle and render useless and destroy the learning of the learned and the philosophy of the philosophers and the cleverness of the clever and the discernment of the discerning; I will frustrate and nullify [them] and bring [them] to nothing.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-28381A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-28382" class="sup">20</span>Where is the wise man (the philosopher)? Where is the scribe (the scholar)? Where is the investigator (the logician, the debater) of this present time and age? Has not God shown up the nonsense and the folly of this world's wisdom?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28383" class="sup">21</span>For when the world with all its earthly wisdom failed to perceive and recognize and know God by means of its own philosophy, God in His wisdom was pleased through the foolishness of preaching [salvation, procured by Christ and to be had through Him], to save those who believed (who clung to and trusted in and relied on Him).<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28384" class="sup">22</span>For while Jews [demandingly] ask for signs and miracles and Greeks pursue philosophy and wisdom,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28385" class="sup">23</span>We preach Christ (the Messiah) crucified, [preaching which] to the Jews is a scandal and an offensive stumbling block [that springs a snare or trap], and to the Gentiles it is absurd and utterly unphilosophical nonsense.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28386" class="sup">24</span>But to those who are called, whether Jew or Greek (Gentile), Christ [is] the Power of God and the Wisdom of God.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28387" class="sup">25</span>[This is] because the foolish thing [that has its source in] God is wiser than men, and the weak thing [that springs] from God is stronger than men.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28388" class="sup">26</span>For [simply] consider your own call, brethren; not many [of you were considered to be] wise according to human estimates and standards, not many influential and powerful, not many of high and noble birth.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28389" class="sup">27</span>[No] for God selected (deliberately chose) what in the world is foolish to put the wise to shame, and what the world calls weak to put the strong to shame.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28390" class="sup">28</span>And God also selected (deliberately chose) what in the world is lowborn and insignificant and branded and treated with contempt, even the things that are nothing, that He might depose and bring to nothing the things that are,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28391" class="sup">29</span>So that no mortal man should [have pretense for glorying and] boast in the presence of God.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28392" class="sup">30</span>But it is from Him that you have your life in Christ Jesus, Whom God made our Wisdom from God, [revealed to us a knowledge of the divine plan of salvation previously hidden, manifesting itself as] our Righteousness [thus making us upright and putting us in right standing with God], and our Consecration [making us pure and holy], and our Redemption [providing our ransom from eternal penalty for sin].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28393" class="sup">31</span>So then, as it is written, Let him who boasts and proudly rejoices and glories, boast and proudly rejoice and glory in the Lord.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-28393B" title="See cross-reference B">B</a>)</sup><p /> </p><p /><strong><br /><hr /><br /></strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-AMP-28369a"><a href="#en-AMP-28369" title="Go to 1 Corinthians 1:7">1 Corinthians 1:7</a> Joseph Thayer, A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament.</li>

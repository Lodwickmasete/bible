<p><h2>Revelation 17</h2><span id="en-AMP-30976" class="sup">1</span>ONE OF the seven angels who had the seven bowls then came and spoke to me, saying, Come with me! I will show you the doom (sentence, judgment) of the great harlot (idolatress) who is seated on many waters,<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30976A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30977" class="sup">2</span>[She] with whom the rulers of the earth have joined in prostitution (idolatry) and with the wine of whose immorality (idolatry) the inhabitants of the earth have become intoxicated.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30977B" title="See cross-reference B">B</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30978" class="sup">3</span>And [the angel] bore me away [rapt] in the Spirit into a desert (wilderness), and I saw a woman seated on a scarlet beast that was all covered with blasphemous titles (names), and he had seven heads and ten horns.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30979" class="sup">4</span>The woman was robed in purple and scarlet and bedecked with gold, precious stones, and pearls, [and she was] holding in her hand a golden cup full of the accursed offenses and the filth of her lewdness and vice.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30979C" title="See cross-reference C">C</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30980" class="sup">5</span>And on her forehead there was inscribed a name of mystery [with a secret symbolic meaning]: Babylon the great, the mother of prostitutes (idolatresses) and of the filth and atrocities and abominations of the earth.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30981" class="sup">6</span>I also saw that the woman was drunk, [drunk] with the blood of the saints (God's people) and the blood of the martyrs [who witnessed] for Jesus. And when I saw her, I was utterly amazed and wondered greatly.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30982" class="sup">7</span>But the angel said to me, Why do you wonder? I will explain to you the [secret symbolic meaning of the] mystery of the woman, as well as of the beast having the seven heads and ten horns that carries her.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30983" class="sup">8</span>The beast that you saw [once] was, but [now] is no more, and he is going to come up out of the Abyss (the bottomless pit) and proceed to go to perdition. And the inhabitants of the earth whose names have not been recorded in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world will be astonished when they look at the beast, because he [once] was, but [now] is no more, and he is [yet] to come.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30983D" title="See cross-reference D">D</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30984" class="sup">9</span>This calls for a mind [to consider that is packed] with wisdom and intelligence [it is something for a particular mode of thinking and judging of thoughts, feelings, and purposes]. The seven heads are seven hills upon which the woman is sitting;<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30985" class="sup">10</span>And they are also seven kings, five of whom have fallen, one still exists [and is reigning]; the other [the seventh] has not yet appeared, and when he does arrive, he must stay [but] a brief time.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30986" class="sup">11</span>And as for the beast that [once] was, but now is no more, he [himself] is an eighth ruler (king, head), but he is of the seven and belongs to them, and he goes to perdition.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30987" class="sup">12</span>Also the ten horns that you observed are ten rulers (kings) who have as yet received no royal dominion, but together they are to receive power and authority as rulers for a single hour, along with the beast.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30987E" title="See cross-reference E">E</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30988" class="sup">13</span>These have one common policy (opinion, purpose), and they deliver their power and authority to the beast.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30989" class="sup">14</span>They will wage war against the Lamb, and the Lamb will triumph over them; for He is Lord of lords and King of kings--and those with Him and on His side are chosen and called [elected] and loyal and faithful followers.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30989F" title="See cross-reference F">F</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30990" class="sup">15</span>And [the angel further] said to me, The waters that you observed, where the harlot is seated, are races and multitudes and nations and dialects (languages).<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30991" class="sup">16</span>And the ten horns that you saw, they and the beast will [be the very ones to] hate the harlot (the idolatrous woman); they will make her cheerless (bereaved, desolate), and they will strip her and eat up her flesh and utterly consume her with fire.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30992" class="sup">17</span>For God has put it into their hearts to carry out His own purpose by acting in harmony in surrendering their royal power and authority to the beast, until the prophetic words (intentions and promises) of God shall be fulfilled.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30993" class="sup">18</span>And the woman that you saw is herself the great city which dominates and controls the rulers and the leaders of the earth.<p /> </p><p /><strong>Cross references:</strong><ol type="A"><li id="cen-AMP-30976A"><a href="#en-AMP-30976" title="Go to Revelation 17:1">Revelation 17:1</a> : er 51:13 </li>

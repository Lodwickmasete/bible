<p><h2>1 Samuel 28</h2><span id="en-AMP-7944" class="sup">1</span>IN THOSE days the Philistines gathered their forces for war against Israel. Achish said to David, Understand that you and your men shall go with me to battle.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7945" class="sup">2</span>David said to Achish, All right, you shall know what your servant can do. Achish said to David, Therefore I will make you my bodyguard always.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7946" class="sup">3</span>Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him in Ramah, his own city. And Saul had put the mediums and the wizards out of the land.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7947" class="sup">4</span>And the Philistines assembled and came and encamped at Shunem; and Saul gathered all Israel and they encamped at Gilboa.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7948" class="sup">5</span>When Saul saw the Philistine host, he was afraid; his heart trembled greatly.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7949" class="sup">6</span>When Saul inquired of the Lord, He refused to answer him, either by dreams or by Urim [a symbol worn by the priest when seeking the will of God for Israel] or by the prophets.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-7949A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-7950" class="sup">7</span>Then Saul said to his servants, Find me a woman who is a medium [between the living and the dead], that I may go and inquire of her. His servants said, Behold, there is a woman who is a medium at Endor.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7951" class="sup">8</span>So Saul disguised himself, put on other raiment, and he and two men with him went and came to the woman at night. He said to her, Perceive for me by the familiar spirit and bring up for me the dead person whom I shall name to you.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7952" class="sup">9</span>The woman said, See here, you know what Saul has done, how he has cut off those who are mediums and wizards out of the land. Why then do you lay a trap for my life to cause my death?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7953" class="sup">10</span>And Saul swore to her by the Lord, saying, As the Lord lives, there shall no punishment come to you for this.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7954" class="sup">11</span>The woman said, Whom shall I bring up for you? He said, Bring up Samuel for me.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7955" class="sup">12</span>And when the woman saw Samuel, she screamed and she said to Saul, Why have you deceived me? For you are Saul!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7956" class="sup">13</span>The king said to her, Be not afraid; what do you see? The woman said to Saul, I see a god [terrifying superhuman being] coming up out of the earth!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7957" class="sup">14</span>He said to her, In what form is he? And she said, An old man comes up, covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground and made obeisance.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7958" class="sup">15</span>And Samuel said to Saul, Why have you disturbed me to bring me up? Saul answered, I am bitterly distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God has departed from me and answers me no more, either by prophets or by dreams. Therefore I have called you, that you may make known to me what I should do.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7959" class="sup">16</span>Samuel said, Why then do you ask me, seeing that the Lord has turned from you and has become your enemy?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7960" class="sup">17</span>The Lord has done to you as He said through me He would do; for [He] has torn the kingdom out of your hands and given it to your neighbor David.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-7960B" title="See cross-reference B">B</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-7961" class="sup">18</span>Because you did not obey the voice of the Lord or execute His fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore the Lord has done this thing to you this day.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7962" class="sup">19</span>Moreover, the Lord will also give Israel with you into the hands of the Philistines, and tomorrow you and your sons shall be with me [among the dead]. The Lord also will give the army of Israel into the hands of the Philistines.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7963" class="sup">20</span>Then immediately Saul fell full length upon the earth floor [of the medium's house], and was exceedingly afraid because of Samuel's words. There was no strength in him, for he had eaten nothing all day and all night.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7964" class="sup">21</span>The woman came to Saul, and seeing that he was greatly troubled, she said to him, Behold, your handmaid has obeyed you, and I have put my life in my hands and have listened to what you said to me.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7965" class="sup">22</span>So now, I pray you, listen also to the voice of your handmaid and let me set a morsel of food before you, and eat, so you may have strength when you go on your way.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7966" class="sup">23</span>But he said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, urged him, and he heeded their words. So he arose from the ground and sat upon the bed.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7967" class="sup">24</span>The woman had a fat calf in the house; she hurried and killed it, and took flour, kneaded it, and baked unleavened bread.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7968" class="sup">25</span>Then she brought it before Saul and his servants, and they ate. Then they rose up and went away that night.<p /> </p><p /><strong>Cross references:</strong><ol type="A"><li id="cen-AMP-7949A"><a href="#en-AMP-7949" title="Go to 1 Samuel 28:6">1 Samuel 28:6</a> : rov 1:24-30 </li>

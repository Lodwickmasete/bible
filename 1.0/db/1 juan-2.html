<p><h2>1 John 2</h2><span id="en-AMP-30550" class="sup">1</span>MY LITTLE children, I write you these things so that you may not violate God's law and sin. But if anyone should sin, we have an Advocate (One Who will intercede for us) with the Father--[it is] Jesus Christ [the all] righteous [upright, just, Who conforms to the Father's will in every purpose, thought, and action].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30551" class="sup">2</span>And He [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30551a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>that same Jesus Himself] is the propitiation (the atoning sacrifice) for our sins, and not for ours alone but also for [the sins of] the whole world.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30552" class="sup">3</span>And this is how we may discern [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30552b" title=" b">b</a>]</sup>daily, by experience] that we are coming to know Him [to perceive, recognize, understand, and become better acquainted with Him]: if we keep (bear in mind, observe, practice) His teachings (precepts, commandments).<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30553" class="sup">4</span>Whoever says, I know Him [I perceive, recognize, understand, and am acquainted with Him] but fails to keep and obey His commandments (teachings) is a liar, and the Truth [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30553c" title=" c">c</a>]</sup>of the Gospel] is not in him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30554" class="sup">5</span>But he who keeps (treasures) His Word [who bears in mind His precepts, who observes His message in its entirety], truly in him has the love of and for God been perfected (completed, reached maturity). By this we may perceive (know, recognize, and be sure) that we are in Him:<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30555" class="sup">6</span>Whoever says he abides in Him ought [as <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30555d" title=" d">d</a>]</sup>a personal debt] to walk and conduct himself in the same way in which He walked and conducted Himself.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30556" class="sup">7</span>Beloved, I am writing you no new commandment, but an old commandment which you have had from the beginning; the old commandment is the message which you have heard [the <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30556e" title=" e">e</a>]</sup>doctrine of salvation through Christ].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30557" class="sup">8</span>Yet I am writing you a new commandment, which is true (is realized) in Him and in you, because the darkness (<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30557f" title=" f">f</a>]</sup>moral blindness) is clearing away and the true Light (<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30557g" title=" g">g</a>]</sup>the revelation of God in Christ) is already shining.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30558" class="sup">9</span>Whoever says he is in the Light and [yet] hates his brother [Christian, <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30558h" title=" h">h</a>]</sup>born-again child of God his Father] is in darkness even until now.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30559" class="sup">10</span>Whoever loves his brother [believer] abides (lives) in the Light, and in It or in him there is no occasion for stumbling or cause for error or sin.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30560" class="sup">11</span>But he who hates (detests, despises) his brother [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30560i" title=" i">i</a>]</sup>in Christ] is in darkness and walking (living) in the dark; he is straying and does not perceive or know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30561" class="sup">12</span>I am writing to you, little children, because for His name's sake your sins are forgiven [pardoned through His name and on account of confessing His name].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30562" class="sup">13</span>I am writing to you, fathers, because you have come to know (recognize, be aware of, and understand) Him Who [has existed] from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have been victorious over the wicked [one]. I write to you, <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30562j" title=" j">j</a>]</sup>boys (lads), because you have come to know (recognize and be aware) of the Father.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30563" class="sup">14</span>I write to you, fathers, because you have come to know (recognize, be conscious of, and understand) Him Who [has existed] from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you are strong and vigorous, and the Word of God is [always] abiding in you (in your hearts), and you have been victorious over the wicked one.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30564" class="sup">15</span>Do not love or cherish the world or the things that are in the world. If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30565" class="sup">16</span>For all that is in the world--the lust of the flesh [craving for sensual gratification] and the lust of the eyes [greedy longings of the mind] and the pride of life [assurance in one's own resources or in the stability of earthly things]--these do not come from the Father but are from the world [itself].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30566" class="sup">17</span>And the world passes away and disappears, and with it the forbidden cravings (the passionate desires, the lust) of it; but he who does the will of God and carries out His purposes in his life abides (remains) forever.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30567" class="sup">18</span><sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30567k" title=" k">k</a>]</sup>Boys (lads), it is the last time (hour, the end of this age). And as you have heard that the antichrist [he who will oppose Christ in the guise of Christ] is coming, even now many antichrists have arisen, which confirms our belief that it is the final (the end) time.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30568" class="sup">19</span>They went out from our number, but they did not [really] belong to us; for if they had been of us, they would have remained with us. But [they withdrew] that it might be plain that they all are not of us.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30569" class="sup">20</span>But you have been anointed by [you hold a sacred appointment from, you have been given an unction from] the Holy One, and you all know [the Truth] or you know all things.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30570" class="sup">21</span>I write to you not because you are ignorant and do not perceive and know the Truth, but because you do perceive and know it, and [know positively] that nothing false (no deception, no lie) is of the Truth.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30571" class="sup">22</span>Who is [such a] liar as he who denies that Jesus is the Christ (the Messiah)? He is the antichrist (the antagonist of Christ), who [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30571l" title=" l">l</a>]</sup>habitually] denies and refuses to acknowledge the Father and the Son.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30572" class="sup">23</span>No one who [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30572m" title=" m">m</a>]</sup>habitually] denies (disowns) the Son <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30572n" title=" n">n</a>]</sup>even has the Father. Whoever confesses (acknowledges and has) the Son has the Father also.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30573" class="sup">24</span>As for you, keep in your hearts what you have heard from the beginning. If what you heard from the first dwells and remains in you, then you will dwell in the Son and in the Father [always].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30574" class="sup">25</span>And this is what He Himself has promised us--the life, the eternal [life].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30575" class="sup">26</span>I write this to you with reference to those who would deceive you [seduce and lead you astray].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30576" class="sup">27</span>But as for you, the anointing (the sacred appointment, the unction) which you received from Him abides [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30576o" title=" o">o</a>]</sup>permanently] in you; [so] then you have no need that anyone should instruct you. But just as His anointing teaches you concerning everything and is true and is no falsehood, so you must abide in (live in, never depart from) Him [being <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30576p" title=" p">p</a>]</sup>rooted in Him, knit to Him], just as [His anointing] has taught you [to do].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30577" class="sup">28</span>And now, little children, abide (live, remain <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30577q" title=" q">q</a>]</sup>permanently) in Him, so that when He is made visible, we may have and enjoy perfect confidence (boldness, assurance) and not be ashamed and shrink from Him at His coming.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30578" class="sup">29</span>If you know (perceive and are sure) that He [Christ] is [absolutely] righteous [conforming to the Father's will in purpose, thought, and action], you may also know (be sure) that everyone who does righteously [and is therefore in like manner conformed to the divine will] is born (begotten) of Him [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30578r" title=" r">r</a>]</sup>God].<p /> </p><p /><strong><br /><hr /><br /></strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-AMP-30551a"><a href="#en-AMP-30551" title="Go to 1 John 2:2">1 John 2:2</a> Marvin Vincent, Word Studies.</li>

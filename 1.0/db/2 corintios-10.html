<p><h2>2 Corinthians 10</h2><span id="en-AMP-28971" class="sup">1</span>NOW I myself, Paul, beseech you, by the gentleness and consideration of Christ [Himself; I] who [am] lowly enough [so they say] when among you face to face, but bold (fearless and outspoken) to you when [I am] absent from you!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28972" class="sup">2</span>I entreat you when I do come [to you] that I may not [be driven to such] boldness as I intend to show toward those few who suspect us of acting according to the flesh [on the low level of worldly motives and as if invested with only human powers].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28973" class="sup">3</span>For though we walk (live) in the flesh, we are not carrying on our warfare according to the flesh and using mere human weapons.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28974" class="sup">4</span>For the weapons of our warfare are not physical [weapons of flesh and blood], but they are mighty before God for the overthrow and destruction of strongholds,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28975" class="sup">5</span>[Inasmuch as we] refute arguments and theories and reasonings and every proud and lofty thing that sets itself up against the [true] knowledge of God; and we lead every thought and purpose away captive into the obedience of Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One),<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28976" class="sup">6</span>Being in readiness to punish every [insubordinate for his] disobedience, when your own submission and obedience [as a church] are fully secured and complete.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28977" class="sup">7</span>Look at [this obvious fact] which is before your eyes. If anyone is confident that he is Christ's, let him reflect and remind himself that even as he is Christ's, so too are we.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28978" class="sup">8</span>For even though I boast rather freely about our power and authority, which the Lord gave for your upbuilding and not for demolishing you, yet I shall not be put to shame [for exceeding the truth],<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28979" class="sup">9</span>Neither would I seem to be overawing or frightening you with my letters;<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28980" class="sup">10</span>For they say, His letters are weighty and impressive and forceful and telling, but his personality and bodily presence are weak, and his speech and delivery are utterly contemptible (of no account).<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28981" class="sup">11</span>Let such people realize that what we say by letters when we are absent, [we put] also into deeds when we are present--<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28982" class="sup">12</span>Not that we [have the audacity to] venture to class or [even to] compare ourselves with some who exalt and furnish testimonials for themselves! However, when they measure themselves with themselves and compare themselves with one another, they are without understanding and behave unwisely.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28983" class="sup">13</span>We, on the other hand, will not boast beyond our legitimate province and proper limit, but will keep within the limits [of our commission which] God has allotted us as our measuring line and which reaches and includes even you.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28984" class="sup">14</span>For we are not overstepping the limits of our province and stretching beyond our ability to reach, as though we reached not (had no legitimate mission) to you, for we were [the very first] to come even as far as to you with the good news (the Gospel) of Christ.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28985" class="sup">15</span>We do not boast therefore, beyond our proper limit, over other men's labors, but we have the hope and confident expectation that as your faith continues to grow, our field among you may be greatly enlarged, still within the limits of our commission,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28986" class="sup">16</span>So that [we may even] preach the Gospel in lands [lying] beyond you, without making a boast of work already done in another [man's] sphere of activity [before we came on the scene].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28987" class="sup">17</span>However, let him who boasts and glories boast and glory in the Lord.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-28987A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-28988" class="sup">18</span>For [it is] not [the man] who praises and commends himself who is approved and accepted, but [it is the person] whom the Lord accredits and commends.<p /> </p><p /><strong>Cross references:</strong><ol type="A"><li id="cen-AMP-28987A"><a href="#en-AMP-28987" title="Go to 2 Corinthians 10:17">2 Corinthians 10:17</a> : er 9:24 </li>

<p><h2>Revelation 13</h2><span id="en-AMP-30909" class="sup">1</span>[AS] <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30909a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>I stood on the sandy beach, I saw a beast coming up out of the sea with ten horns and seven heads. On his horns he had ten royal crowns (diadems) and blasphemous titles (names) on his heads.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30910" class="sup">2</span>And the beast that I saw resembled a leopard, but his feet were like those of a bear and his mouth was like that of a lion. And to him the dragon gave his [own] might and power and his [own] throne and great dominion.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30911" class="sup">3</span>And one of his heads seemed to have a deadly wound. But his death stroke was healed; and the whole earth went after the beast in amazement and admiration.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30912" class="sup">4</span>They fell down and paid homage to the dragon, because he had bestowed on the beast all his dominion and authority; they also praised and worshiped the beast, exclaiming, Who is a match for the beast, and, Who can make war against him?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30913" class="sup">5</span>And the beast was given the power of speech, uttering boastful and blasphemous words, and he was given freedom to exert his authority and to exercise his will during forty-two months (three and a half years).<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30913A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30914" class="sup">6</span>And he opened his mouth to speak slanders against God, blaspheming His name and His abode, [even vilifying] those who live in heaven.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30915" class="sup">7</span>He was further permitted to wage war on God's holy people (the saints) and to overcome them. And power was given him to extend his authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation,<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30915B" title="See cross-reference B">B</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30916" class="sup">8</span>And all the inhabitants of the earth will fall down in adoration and pay him homage, everyone whose name has not been recorded in the Book of Life of the Lamb that was slain [in sacrifice] <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30916b" title=" b">b</a>]</sup>from the foundation of the world.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30917" class="sup">9</span>If anyone is able to hear, let him listen:<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30918" class="sup">10</span>Whoever leads into captivity will himself go into captivity; if anyone slays with the sword, with the sword must he be slain. Herein is [the call for] the patience and the faith and fidelity of the saints (God's people).<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30918C" title="See cross-reference C">C</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30919" class="sup">11</span>Then I saw another beast rising up out of the land [itself]; he had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke (roared) like a dragon.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30920" class="sup">12</span>He exerts all the power and right of control of the former beast in his presence, and causes the earth and those who dwell upon it to exalt and deify the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed, and to worship him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30921" class="sup">13</span>He performs great signs (startling miracles), even making fire fall from the sky to the earth in men's sight.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30922" class="sup">14</span>And because of the signs (miracles) which he is allowed to perform in the presence of the [first] beast, he deceives those who inhabit the earth, commanding them to erect a statue (an image) in the likeness of the beast who was wounded by the [small] sword and still lived.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30922D" title="See cross-reference D">D</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30923" class="sup">15</span>And he is permitted [also] to impart the breath of life into the beast's image, so that the statue of the beast could actually talk and cause to be put to death those who would not bow down and worship the image of the beast.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30923E" title="See cross-reference E">E</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30924" class="sup">16</span>Also he compels all [alike], both small and great, both the rich and the poor, both free and slave, to be marked with an inscription [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30924c" title=" c">c</a>]</sup>stamped] on their right hands or on their foreheads,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30925" class="sup">17</span>So that no one will have power to buy or sell unless he bears the stamp (mark, inscription), [that is] the name of the beast or the number of his name.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30926" class="sup">18</span>Here is [room for] discernment [a call for the wisdom <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30926d" title=" d">d</a>]</sup>of interpretation]. Let anyone who has intelligence (penetration and insight enough) calculate the number of the beast, for it is a human number [the number of a certain man]; his number is 666.<p /> </p><p /><strong><br /><hr /><br /></strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-AMP-30909a"><a href="#en-AMP-30909" title="Go to Revelation 13:1">Revelation 13:1</a> Many ancient manuscripts read "he."</li>

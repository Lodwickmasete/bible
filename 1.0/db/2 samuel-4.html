<p><h2>2 Samuel 4</h2><span id="en-AMP-8122" class="sup">1</span>WHEN ISH-BOSHETH, Saul's son [king over Israel], heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his courage failed, and all the Israelites were troubled and dismayed.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8123" class="sup">2</span>Saul's son had two men who were captains of raiding bands. One was named Baanah and the other Rechab, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite of Benjamin--for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8124" class="sup">3</span>And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim and have been sojourners there to this day.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8125" class="sup">4</span>Jonathan, Saul's son, had a son who was a cripple in his feet. He was five years old when the news came out of Jezreel [of the deaths] of Saul and Jonathan. And the boy's nurse took him up and fled; and in her haste, he fell and became lame. His name was Mephibosheth.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8126" class="sup">5</span>Now the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went about in the heat of the day to the house of Ish-bosheth, who lay resting on his bed at noon.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8127" class="sup">6</span>And they came into the interior of the house as though they were delivering wheat, and they smote him in the body; and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8128" class="sup">7</span>Now when they had come into the house and he lay on his bed in his bedroom, they [not only] smote and slew him, [but] beheaded him and took his head and went by the way of the plain all night.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8129" class="sup">8</span>And they brought the head of Ish-bosheth to David at Hebron and said to the king, Behold, the head of Ish-bosheth son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life; and the Lord has avenged my lord the king this day on Saul and on his offspring.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8130" class="sup">9</span>And David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, As the Lord lives, Who redeemed my life out of all adversity,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8131" class="sup">10</span>When one told me, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking he was bringing good news, I seized and slew him in Ziklag who expected me to give him a reward for his news.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8132" class="sup">11</span>How much more--when wicked men have slain a just man in his own house on his bed--shall I not now require his blood of your hand and remove you from the earth!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8133" class="sup">12</span>David commanded his young men, and they slew them and cut off their hands and feet and hanged them over the pool in Hebron. But they took Ish-bosheth's head and buried it in Hebron in the tomb of Abner [his relative and once chief supporter].<p /> </p><p /><br /></div>

<p><h2>1 Thessalonians 4</h2><span id="en-AMP-29603" class="sup">1</span>FURTHERMORE, <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-29603a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>BRETHREN, we beg and admonish you in [virtue of our union with] the Lord Jesus, that [you follow the instructions which] you learned from us about how you ought to walk so as to please and gratify God, as indeed you are doing, [and] that you do so even more and more abundantly [attaining yet greater perfection in living this life].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29604" class="sup">2</span>For you know what charges and precepts we gave you [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-29604b" title=" b">b</a>]</sup>on the authority and by the inspiration of] the Lord Jesus.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29605" class="sup">3</span>For this is the will of God, that you should be consecrated (separated and set apart for pure and holy living): that you should abstain and shrink from all sexual vice,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29606" class="sup">4</span>That each one of you should know how to <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-29606c" title=" c">c</a>]</sup>possess (control, manage) his own <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-29606d" title=" d">d</a>]</sup>body in consecration (purity, separated from things profane) and honor,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29607" class="sup">5</span>Not [to be used] in the passion of lust like the heathen, who are ignorant of the true God and have no knowledge of His will,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29608" class="sup">6</span>That no man transgress and overreach his brother and defraud him in this matter or defraud his brother in business. For the Lord is an avenger in all these things, as we have already warned you solemnly and <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-29608e" title=" e">e</a>]</sup>told you plainly.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29609" class="sup">7</span>For God has not called us to impurity but to consecration [to dedicate ourselves to the most thorough purity].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29610" class="sup">8</span>Therefore whoever disregards (sets aside and rejects this) disregards not man but God, Whose [very] Spirit [Whom] He gives to you is holy (chaste, pure).<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29611" class="sup">9</span>But concerning brotherly love [for all other Christians], you have no need to have anyone write you, for you yourselves have been [personally] taught by God to love one another.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29612" class="sup">10</span>And indeed you already are [extending and displaying your love] to all the brethren throughout Macedonia. But we beseech and earnestly exhort you, brethren, that you <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-29612f" title=" f">f</a>]</sup>excel [in this matter] more and more,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29613" class="sup">11</span>To make it your ambition and definitely endeavor to live quietly and peacefully, to mind your own affairs, and to work with your hands, as we charged you,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29614" class="sup">12</span>So that you may bear yourselves becomingly and be correct and honorable and command the respect of the outside world, being dependent on nobody [self-supporting] and having need of nothing.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29615" class="sup">13</span>Now also we would not have you ignorant, brethren, about those who fall asleep [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-29615g" title=" g">g</a>]</sup>in death], that you may not grieve [for them] as the rest do who have no hope [beyond the grave].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29616" class="sup">14</span>For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so God will also bring with Him through Jesus those who have fallen asleep [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-29616h" title=" h">h</a>]</sup>in death].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29617" class="sup">15</span>For this we declare to you by the Lord's [own] word, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord shall in no way precede [into His presence] or have any advantage at all over those who have previously fallen asleep [in Him <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-29617i" title=" i">i</a>]</sup>in death].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29618" class="sup">16</span>For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a loud cry of summons, with the shout of an archangel, and with the blast of the trumpet of God. And those who have departed this life in Christ will rise first.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29619" class="sup">17</span>Then we, the living ones who remain [on the earth], shall simultaneously be caught up along with [the resurrected dead] in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and so always (through the eternity of the eternities) we shall be with the Lord!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29620" class="sup">18</span>Therefore comfort and encourage one another with these words.<p /> </p><p /><strong><br /><hr /><br /></strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-AMP-29603a"><a href="#en-AMP-29603" title="Go to 1 Thessalonians 4:1">1 Thessalonians 4:1</a> Marvin Vincent, Word Studies.</li>

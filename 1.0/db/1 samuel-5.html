<p><h2>1 Samuel 5</h2><span id="en-AMP-7321" class="sup">1</span>THE PHILISTINES brought the ark of God from Ebenezer to Ashdod.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7322" class="sup">2</span>They took the ark of God into the house of Dagon and set it beside Dagon [their idol].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7323" class="sup">3</span>When they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon had fallen upon his face on the ground before the ark of the Lord. So they took Dagon and set him in his place again.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7324" class="sup">4</span>But when they arose early the next morning, behold, Dagon had again fallen on his face on the ground before the ark of the Lord, and [his] head and both the palms of his hands were lying cut off on the threshold; only the trunk of Dagon was left him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7325" class="sup">5</span>This is the reason neither the priests of Dagon nor any who come into Dagon's house tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7326" class="sup">6</span>But the hand of the Lord was heavy upon the people of Ashdod, and He caused [mice to spring up and there was] very deadly destruction and He smote the people with [very painful] tumors or boils, both Ashdod and its territory.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7327" class="sup">7</span>When the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel must not remain with us, for His hand is heavy on us and on Dagon our god.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7328" class="sup">8</span>So they sent and gathered all the lords of the Philistines to them and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? They answered, Let [it] be carried around to Gath. So they carried the ark of the God of Israel there.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7329" class="sup">9</span>But after they had carried it to Gath, the hand of the Lord was against the city, causing an exceedingly great panic [at the deaths from the plague], for He afflicted the people of the city, both small and great, and tumors or boils broke out on them.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7330" class="sup">10</span>So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And as [it] came, the people of Ekron cried out, They have brought the ark of the God of Israel to us to slay us and our people!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7331" class="sup">11</span>So they sent and assembled all the lords of the Philistines and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel; let it return to its own place, that it may not slay us and our people. For there was a deadly panic throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-7332" class="sup">12</span>The men who had not died were stricken with very painful tumors or boils, and the cry of the city went up to heaven.<p /> </p><p /><br /></div>

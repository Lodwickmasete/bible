<p><h2>1 Chronicles 23</h2><span id="en-AMP-10985" class="sup">1</span>WHEN DAVID was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10986" class="sup">2</span>David assembled all the leaders of Israel, with the priests and Levites.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10987" class="sup">3</span>The Levites thirty years old and upward numbered, man by man, 38,000,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10988" class="sup">4</span>Of whom <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-10988a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>24,000 were to oversee the work of the house of the Lord and 6,000 were to be officers and judges.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10989" class="sup">5</span>And, said David, 4,000 shall be gatekeepers and 4,000 are to praise the Lord with the instruments which I made for praise.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10990" class="sup">6</span>And David organized them in sections according to the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10991" class="sup">7</span>Of the Gershonites: Ladan (Libni) and Shimei.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10992" class="sup">8</span>The sons of Ladan: Jehiel the chief, Zetham, and Joel--three in all.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10993" class="sup">9</span>The sons of Shimei: Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran--three in all.

Of these four sons of Shimei,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10995" class="sup">11</span>Jahath was chief and Zizah the second, but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons [not enough for a father's house or clan]; so they were counted together as one father's house.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10996" class="sup">12</span>The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel--four in all.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10997" class="sup">13</span>The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses. Aaron was set apart to sanctify him as most holy and to consecrate the most holy things, that he and his sons forever might burn incense before the Lord, minister to Him, and bless in His name [and the character which that name denotes] forever.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10998" class="sup">14</span>But the sons of Moses the man of God were named among the tribe of Levi.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10999" class="sup">15</span>The sons of Moses: Gershom and Eliezer.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11000" class="sup">16</span>The son of Gershom: Shebuel the chief.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11001" class="sup">17</span>The son of Eliezer: Rehabiah the chief.

Note these features of it: 1. The Levites were divided into twenty-four rotating divisions (I Chron. 24:6-19). 2. One thousand Levites on duty at one time for Solomon's temple, considering the many purposes and cost of the building, its ornate ritual, and the scale of the work, is not unreasonable according to authorities. 3. In the primitive simplicity of the wilderness, the worshiper killed the animal he brought for an offering, skinned it, cut it in pieces, and washed the entrails and legs. But now all these services were the duty of the Levites or Nethinim (servants of the temple); in addition, the number of worshipers had greatly increased (hence the need for a large number of Levites).</li>

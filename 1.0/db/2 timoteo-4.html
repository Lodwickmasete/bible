<p><h2>2 Timothy 4</h2><span id="en-AMP-29870" class="sup">1</span>I CHARGE [you] in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, Who is to judge the living and the dead, and by (in the light of) His coming and His kingdom:<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29871" class="sup">2</span>Herald and preach the Word! Keep your sense of urgency [stand by, be at hand and ready], whether the opportunity seems to be favorable or unfavorable. [Whether it is convenient or inconvenient, whether it is welcome or unwelcome, you as preacher of the Word are to show people in what way their lives are wrong.] And convince them, rebuking and correcting, warning and urging and encouraging them, being unflagging and inexhaustible in patience and teaching.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29872" class="sup">3</span>For the time is coming when [people] will not tolerate (endure) sound and wholesome instruction, but, having ears itching [for something pleasing and gratifying], they will gather to themselves one teacher after another to a considerable number, chosen to satisfy their own liking and to foster the errors they hold,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29873" class="sup">4</span>And will turn aside from hearing the truth and wander off into myths and man-made fictions.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29874" class="sup">5</span>As for you, be calm and cool and steady, accept and suffer unflinchingly every hardship, do the work of an evangelist, fully perform all the duties of your ministry.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29875" class="sup">6</span>For I am already about to be sacrificed [my life is about to be poured out as a drink offering]; the time of my [spirit's] release [from the body] is at hand and I will soon go free.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29876" class="sup">7</span>I have fought the good (worthy, honorable, and noble) fight, I have finished the race, I have kept (firmly held) the faith.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29877" class="sup">8</span>[As to what remains] henceforth there is laid up for me the [victor's] crown of righteousness [for being right with God and doing right], which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me and recompense me on that [great] day--and not to me only, but also to all those who have loved and yearned for and welcomed His appearing (His return).<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29878" class="sup">9</span>Make every effort to come to me soon.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29879" class="sup">10</span>For Demas has deserted me for love of this present world and has gone to Thessalonica; Crescens [has gone] to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29880" class="sup">11</span>Luke alone is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, for he is very helpful to me for the ministry.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29881" class="sup">12</span>Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29882" class="sup">13</span>[When] you come, bring the cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus, also the books, especially the parchments.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29883" class="sup">14</span>Alexander the coppersmith did me great wrongs. The Lord will pay him back for his actions.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29884" class="sup">15</span>Beware of him yourself, for he opposed and resisted our message very strongly and exceedingly.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29885" class="sup">16</span>At my first trial no one acted in my defense [as my advocate] or took my part or [even] stood with me, but all forsook me. May it not be charged against them!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29886" class="sup">17</span>But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me, so that through me the [Gospel] message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it. So I was delivered out of the jaws of the lion.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29887" class="sup">18</span>[And indeed] the Lord will certainly deliver and <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-29887a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>draw me to Himself from every assault of evil. He will preserve and bring me safe unto His heavenly kingdom. To Him be the glory forever and ever. Amen (so be it).<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29888" class="sup">19</span>Give my greetings to Prisca and Aquila and to the household of Onesiphorus.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29889" class="sup">20</span>Erastus stayed on at Corinth, but Trophimus I left ill at Miletus.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29890" class="sup">21</span>Do hasten and try your best to come to me before winter. Eubulus wishes to be remembered to you, as do Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brethren.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29891" class="sup">22</span>The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace (God's favor and blessing) be with you. Amen (so be it). </p><p /><strong><br /><hr /><br /></strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-AMP-29887a"><a href="#en-AMP-29887" title="Go to 2 Timothy 4:18">2 Timothy 4:18</a> Joseph Thayer, A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament: A primary meaning of the Greek ruomai: "draw to one's self."</li>

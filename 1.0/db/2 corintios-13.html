<p><h2>2 Corinthians 13</h2><span id="en-AMP-29043" class="sup">1</span>THIS IS the third time that I am coming to you. By the testimony of two or three witnesses must any charge and every accusing statement be sustained and confirmed.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-29043A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-29044" class="sup">2</span>I have already warned those who sinned formerly and all the rest also, and I warn them now again while I am absent, as I did when present on my second visit, that if I come back, I will not spare [them],<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29045" class="sup">3</span>Since you desire and seek [perceptible] proof of the Christ Who speaks in and through me. [For He] is not weak and feeble in dealing with you, but is a mighty power within you;<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29046" class="sup">4</span>For though He was crucified in weakness, yet He goes on living by the power of God. And though we too are weak in Him [as He was humanly weak], yet in dealing with you [we shall show ourselves] alive and strong in [fellowship with] Him by the power of God.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29047" class="sup">5</span>Examine and test and evaluate your own selves to see whether you are holding to your faith and showing the proper fruits of it. Test and prove yourselves [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-29047a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>not Christ]. Do you not yourselves realize and know [thoroughly by an ever-increasing experience] that Jesus Christ is in you--unless you are [counterfeits] disapproved on trial and rejected?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29048" class="sup">6</span>But I hope you will recognize and know that we are not disapproved on trial and rejected.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29049" class="sup">7</span>But I pray to God that you may do nothing wrong, not in order that we [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-29049b" title=" b">b</a>]</sup>our teaching] may appear to be approved, but that you may continue doing right, [though] we may seem to have failed and be unapproved.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29050" class="sup">8</span>For we can do nothing against the Truth [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-29050c" title=" c">c</a>]</sup>not serve any party or personal interest], but only for the Truth [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-29050d" title=" d">d</a>]</sup>which is the Gospel].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29051" class="sup">9</span>For we are glad when we are weak (<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-29051e" title=" e">e</a>]</sup>unapproved) and you are really strong. And this we also pray for: your all-round strengthening and perfecting of soul.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29052" class="sup">10</span>So I write these things while I am absent from you, that when I come to you, I may not have to deal sharply in my use of the authority which the Lord has given me [to be employed, however] for building [you] up and not for tearing [you] down.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29053" class="sup">11</span>Finally, brethren, farewell (rejoice)! Be strengthened (perfected, completed, made what you ought to be); be encouraged and consoled and comforted; be of the same [agreeable] mind one with another; live in peace, and [then] the God of love [Who is the Source of affection, goodwill, love, and benevolence toward men] and the Author and Promoter of peace will be with you.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29054" class="sup">12</span>Greet one another with a consecrated kiss.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29055" class="sup">13</span>All the saints (the people of God here) salute you.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29056" class="sup">14</span>The grace (favor and spiritual blessing) of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the presence and fellowship (the communion and sharing together, and participation) in the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen (so be it). </p><p /><strong><br /><hr /><br /></strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-AMP-29047a"><a href="#en-AMP-29047" title="Go to 2 Corinthians 13:5">2 Corinthians 13:5</a> Marvin Vincent, Word Studies.</li>

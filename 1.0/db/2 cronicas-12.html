<p><h2>2 Chronicles 12</h2><span id="en-AMP-11439" class="sup">1</span>WHEN REHOBOAM had established the kingdom and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the Lord, and all Israel with him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11440" class="sup">2</span>And in the fifth year of King Rehoboam, because they had transgressed and been unfaithful to the Lord, Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11441" class="sup">3</span>With 1,200 chariots and 60,000 horsemen, and the people were without number who came with him from Egypt--the Libyans, Sukkiim, and Ethiopians.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11442" class="sup">4</span>And he took the fortified cities of Judah and came on to Jerusalem.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11443" class="sup">5</span>Then Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and the princes of Judah who had gathered at Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said to them, Thus says the Lord: You have forsaken Me, so I have abandoned you into the hands of Shishak.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11444" class="sup">6</span>Then the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said, The Lord is righteous.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11445" class="sup">7</span>And when the Lord saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the Lord came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled themselves, so I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance; and My wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11446" class="sup">8</span>Nevertheless, they shall be his servants, that they may know [the difference between] My service and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11447" class="sup">9</span>So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem; he took away the treasures of the house of the Lord and of the king's house. He took everything. He took away also the shields of gold Solomon had made.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11448" class="sup">10</span>Instead of them King Rehoboam made shields of bronze and committed them to the hands of the officers of the guard who kept the door of the king's house.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11449" class="sup">11</span>And whenever the king entered the Lord's house, the guards came and got the shields of bronze and brought them again into the guard chamber.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11450" class="sup">12</span>When Rehoboam humbled himself, the wrath of the Lord turned from him, so as not to destroy him entirely; also in Judah conditions were good.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11451" class="sup">13</span>So King Rehoboam established and strengthened himself in Jerusalem and reigned. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city in which the Lord had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to put His Name [and the symbol of His presence]. His mother was Naamah an Ammonitess.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11452" class="sup">14</span>And he did evil because he did not set his heart to seek (inquire of, yearn for) the Lord with all his desire.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11453" class="sup">15</span>Now the acts of Rehoboam, from first to last, are they not written in the histories of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer regarding genealogies? There were wars between Rehoboam of Judah and Jeroboam of Israel continually.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11454" class="sup">16</span>And Rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried in the City of David; and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.<p /> </p><p /><br /></div>

Clothe (apron) yourselves, all of you, with humility [as the garb of a servant, <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30469b" title=" b">b</a>]</sup>so that its covering cannot possibly be stripped from you, with freedom from pride and arrogance] toward one another. For God sets Himself against the proud (the insolent, the overbearing, the disdainful, the presumptuous, the boastful)--[and He opposes, frustrates, and defeats them], but gives grace (favor, blessing) to the humble.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30469A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30470" class="sup">6</span>Therefore humble yourselves [demote, lower yourselves in your own estimation] under the mighty hand of God, that in due time He may exalt you,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30471" class="sup">7</span>Casting the <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30471c" title=" c">c</a>]</sup>whole of your care [all your anxieties, all your worries, all your concerns, <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30471d" title=" d">d</a>]</sup>once and for all] on Him, for He cares for you affectionately and cares about you <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30471e" title=" e">e</a>]</sup>watchfully.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30471B" title="See cross-reference B">B</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30472" class="sup">8</span>Be well balanced (temperate, sober of mind), be vigilant and cautious at all times; for that enemy of yours, the devil, roams around like a lion roaring [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30472f" title=" f">f</a>]</sup>in fierce hunger], seeking someone to seize upon and devour.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30473" class="sup">9</span>Withstand him; be firm in faith [against his onset--rooted, established, strong, immovable, and determined], knowing that the same (<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30473g" title=" g">g</a>]</sup>identical) sufferings are appointed to your brotherhood (the whole body of Christians) throughout the world.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30474" class="sup">10</span>And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace [Who imparts all blessing and favor], Who has called you to His [own] eternal glory in Christ Jesus, will Himself complete and make you what you ought to be, establish and ground you securely, and strengthen, and settle you.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30475" class="sup">11</span>To Him be the dominion (power, authority, rule) forever and ever.

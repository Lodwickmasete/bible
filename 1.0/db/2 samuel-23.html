<p><h2>2 Samuel 23</h2><span id="en-AMP-8655" class="sup">1</span>NOW THESE are the last words of David: David son of Jesse says, and the man who was raised on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet psalmist of Israel, says,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8656" class="sup">2</span>The Spirit of the Lord spoke in and by me, and His word was upon my tongue.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8657" class="sup">3</span>The God of Israel spoke, the Rock of Israel said to me, When one rules over men righteously, ruling in the fear of God,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8658" class="sup">4</span>He dawns on them like the morning light when the sun rises on a cloudless morning, when the tender grass springs out of the earth through clear shining after rain.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8659" class="sup">5</span>Truly does not my house stand so with God? For He has made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things, and sure. For will He not cause to prosper all my help and my desire?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8660" class="sup">6</span>But wicked, godless, and worthless lives are all like thorns to be thrust away, because they cannot be taken with the hand.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8661" class="sup">7</span>But the man who touches them arms himself with iron and the shaft of a spear, and they are utterly consumed with fire on the spot.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8662" class="sup">8</span>These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: Josheb-basshebeth, a Tahchemonite, chief of the Three [heroes], known also as Adino the Eznite; he wielded his spear and went against 800 men, who were slain at one time.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-8662A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-8663" class="sup">9</span>Next to him among the three mighty men was Eleazar son of Dodo, son of Ahohi. He was with David when they defied the Philistines assembled there for battle, and the men of Israel had departed.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8664" class="sup">10</span>[Eleazar] arose and struck down the Philistines until his hand was weary and clung to the sword. The Lord wrought a great deliverance and victory that day; the men returned after him only to take the spoil.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8665" class="sup">11</span>Next to [Eleazar] was Shammah son of Agee the Hararite. The Philistines were gathered at Lehi on a piece of ground full of lentils; and the [Israelites] fled from the Philistines.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8666" class="sup">12</span>But he stood in the midst of the ground and defended it and slew the Philistines; and the Lord wrought a great victory.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8667" class="sup">13</span>And three of the thirty chief men went down at harvest time to David in the cave of Adullam, and a troop of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8668" class="sup">14</span>And David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8669" class="sup">15</span>And David said longingly, Oh, that someone would give me a drink of water from the well of Bethlehem by the gate!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8670" class="sup">16</span>And the three mighty men broke through the army of the Philistines and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem by the gate and brought it to David. But he would not drink it, but poured it out to the Lord.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8671" class="sup">17</span>And he said, Be it far from me, O Lord, to drink this. Is it not [the same as] the blood of the men who went at the risk of their lives? So he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty men.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8672" class="sup">18</span>Now Abishai the brother of Joab son of Zeruiah was chief of the Three. He wielded his spear against 300 men and slew them, and won a name beside the Three.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8673" class="sup">19</span>Was he not most renowned of the Three? So he was their captain; however, he did not attain to the Three.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8674" class="sup">20</span>And Benaiah son of Jehoiada, a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many notable acts, slew two lionlike men of Moab. He went down also and slew a lion in a pit on a snowy day.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8675" class="sup">21</span>And he slew an Egyptian, a handsome man. The Egyptian had a spear in his hand, but Benaiah went down to him with a staff, snatched the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew the man with his own spear.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8676" class="sup">22</span>These things Benaiah son of Jehoiada did, and won a name beside the three mighty men.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8677" class="sup">23</span>He was more renowned than the Thirty, but he attained not to the [first] Three. David set him over his guard or council.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8678" class="sup">24</span>Asahel brother of Joab was one of the Thirty; then Elhanan son of Dodo of Bethlehem,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8679" class="sup">25</span>Shammah of Harod, Elika of Harod,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8680" class="sup">26</span>Helez the Paltite, Ira son of Ikkesh of Tekoa,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8681" class="sup">27</span>Abiezer of Anathoth, Mebunnai the Hushathite,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8682" class="sup">28</span>Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai of Netophah,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8683" class="sup">29</span>Heleb son of Baanah of Netophah, Ittai son of Ribai of Gibeah of the Benjamites.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8684" class="sup">30</span>Benaiah of Pirathon, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8685" class="sup">31</span>Abi-albon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8686" class="sup">32</span>Eliahba of Shaalbon, the sons of Jashen, Jonathan,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8687" class="sup">33</span>Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam son of Sharar the Hararite,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8688" class="sup">34</span>Eliphelet son of Ahasbai, son of Maacah, Eliam son of Ahithophel of Giloh,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8689" class="sup">35</span>Hezro (Hezrai) of Carmel, Paarai the Arbite,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8690" class="sup">36</span>Igal son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8691" class="sup">37</span>Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai of Beeroth, armor-bearer of Joab son of Zeruiah,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8692" class="sup">38</span>Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8693" class="sup">39</span>Uriah the Hittite--thirty-seven in all.<p /> </p><p /><strong>Cross references:</strong><ol type="A"><li id="cen-AMP-8662A"><a href="#en-AMP-8662" title="Go to 2 Samuel 23:8">2 Samuel 23:8</a> :  Chron 11:11 </li>

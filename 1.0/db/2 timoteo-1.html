<p><h2>2 Timothy 1</h2><span id="en-AMP-29809" class="sup">1</span>PAUL, AN apostle (special messenger) of Christ Jesus by the will of God, according to the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29810" class="sup">2</span>To Timothy, [my] beloved child: Grace (favor and spiritual blessing), mercy, and [heart] peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29811" class="sup">3</span>I thank God Whom I worship with a pure conscience, <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-29811a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>in the spirit of my fathers, when without ceasing I remember you night and day in my prayers,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29812" class="sup">4</span>And when, as I recall your tears, I yearn to see you so that I may be filled with joy.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29813" class="sup">5</span>I am calling up memories of your sincere and unqualified faith (the <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-29813b" title=" b">b</a>]</sup>leaning of your entire personality on God in Christ in absolute trust and confidence in His power, wisdom, and goodness), [a faith] that first lived permanently in [the heart of] your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and now, I am [fully] persuaded, [dwells] in you also.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29814" class="sup">6</span>That is why I would remind you to stir up (rekindle the embers of, fan the flame of, and keep burning) the [gracious] gift of God, [the inner fire] that is in you by means of the laying on of my hands [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-29814c" title=" c">c</a>]</sup>with those of the elders at your ordination].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29815" class="sup">7</span>For God did not give us a spirit of timidity (of cowardice, of craven and cringing and fawning fear), but [He has given us a spirit] of power and of love and of calm and well-balanced mind and discipline and self-control.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29816" class="sup">8</span>Do not blush or be ashamed then, to testify to and for our Lord, nor of me, a prisoner for His sake, but [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-29816d" title=" d">d</a>]</sup>with me] take your share of the suffering [to which the preaching] of the Gospel [may expose you, and do it] in the power of God.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29817" class="sup">9</span>[For it is He] Who delivered and saved us and called us with a calling in itself holy and leading to holiness [to a life of consecration, a vocation of holiness]; [He did it] not because of anything of merit that we have done, but because of and to further His own purpose and grace (unmerited favor) which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began [eternal ages ago].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29818" class="sup">10</span>[It is that purpose and grace] which He now has made known and has fully disclosed and made real [to us] through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, Who annulled death and made it of no effect and brought life and immortality (immunity from eternal death) to light through the Gospel.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29819" class="sup">11</span>For [the proclaiming of] this [Gospel] I was appointed a herald (preacher) and an apostle (special messenger) and a teacher of the Gentiles.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29820" class="sup">12</span>And this is why I am suffering as I do. Still I am not ashamed, for I know (perceive, have knowledge of, and am acquainted with) Him Whom I have believed (adhered to and trusted in and relied on), and I am [positively] persuaded that He is able to guard and keep that which has been entrusted to me and which <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-29820e" title=" e">e</a>]</sup>I have committed [to Him] until that day.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29821" class="sup">13</span>Hold fast and follow the pattern of wholesome and sound teaching which you have heard from me, in [all] the faith and love which are [for us] in Christ Jesus.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29822" class="sup">14</span>Guard and keep [with the greatest care] the precious and excellently adapted [Truth] which has been entrusted [to you], by the [help of the] Holy Spirit Who makes His home in us.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29823" class="sup">15</span>You already know that all who are in Asia turned away and forsook me, Phygelus and Hermogenes among them.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29824" class="sup">16</span>May the Lord grant [His] mercy to the family of Onesiphorus, for he often showed me kindness and ministered to my needs [comforting and reviving and bracing me like fresh air]! He was not ashamed of my chains and imprisonment [for Christ's sake].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29825" class="sup">17</span>No, rather when he reached Rome, he searched diligently and eagerly for me and found me.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-29826" class="sup">18</span>May the Lord grant to him that he may find mercy from the Lord on that [great] day! And you know how many things he did for me and what a help he was at Ephesus [you know better than I can tell you].<p /> </p><p /><strong><br /><hr /><br /></strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-AMP-29811a"><a href="#en-AMP-29811" title="Go to 2 Timothy 1:3">2 Timothy 1:3</a> Marvin Vincent, Word Studies in the New Testament.</li>

<p><h2>2 Chronicles 10</h2><span id="en-AMP-11397" class="sup">1</span>REHOBOAM WENT to Shechem, for all Israel had gone to Shechem to make him king.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11398" class="sup">2</span>Jeroboam the son of Nebat was in Egypt, where he had fled from the presence of King Solomon, when he heard about the new king; so Jeroboam returned from Egypt.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11399" class="sup">3</span>And the people sent for him. So Jeroboam and all Israel came to Rehoboam, saying,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11400" class="sup">4</span>Your father [King Solomon] made our yoke grievous. So now make lighter the grievous service of your father and his heavy yoke that he put upon us, and we will serve you.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11401" class="sup">5</span>Rehoboam replied, Come again to me after three days. And the people departed.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11402" class="sup">6</span>King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men who stood before Solomon his father while he was alive, saying, What counsel do you give me in reply to the people?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11403" class="sup">7</span>And they answered him, If you are kind to [these] people and please them and speak good words to them, they will be your servants forever.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11404" class="sup">8</span>But the king forsook the counsel which the old men gave him and took counsel with the young men who were brought up with him and stood before him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11405" class="sup">9</span>And he said to them, What answer do you advise that we give to the demand of [these] people, Make the yoke your father put upon us lighter?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11406" class="sup">10</span>The young men who were brought up with him said to him, Tell the people who said to you, Your father made our yoke heavy, but you make it lighter: My little finger is thicker than my father's loins.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11407" class="sup">11</span>For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will add to your yoke. My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11408" class="sup">12</span>The third day Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam as he had said.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11409" class="sup">13</span>And the king answered them harshly, forsaking the counsel of the old men,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11410" class="sup">14</span>And answered them after the advice of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11411" class="sup">15</span>So the king did not heed the people, for it was <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-11411a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>brought about of God, that the Lord might perform His word which He spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam son of Nebat.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-11411A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-11412" class="sup">16</span>And when all Israel saw that the king would not listen to and heed them, they answered [him], What portion have we in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. Every man to your tents, O Israel! Now, David [tribe of Judah], see to your own house [under your tyrant King Rehoboam]! So all Israel went to their homes.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11413" class="sup">17</span>But as for the Israelites who dwelt in Judah's cities, Rehoboam ruled over them.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11414" class="sup">18</span>Then King Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was over the forced labor, and the Israelites stoned him and he died. But King Rehoboam hastened to get up to his royal chariot to flee to Jerusalem.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-11415" class="sup">19</span>And Israel has rebelled against the house of David to this day.<p /> </p><p /><strong><br /><hr /><br /></strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-AMP-11411a"><a href="#en-AMP-11411" title="Go to 2 Chronicles 10:15">2 Chronicles 10:15</a> God permitted the revolt of the northern tribes, intending it as a punishment of the house of David for Solomon's apostasy (Robert Jamieson, A.R.

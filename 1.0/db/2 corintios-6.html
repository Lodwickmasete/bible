<p><h2>2 Corinthians 6</h2><span id="en-AMP-28898" class="sup">1</span>LABORING TOGETHER [as God's fellow workers] with Him then, we beg of you not to receive the grace of God in vain [that <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28898a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>merciful kindness by which God exerts His holy influence on souls and turns them to Christ, keeping and strengthening them--do not receive it to no purpose].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28899" class="sup">2</span>For He says, In the time of favor (of an assured welcome) I have listened to and heeded your call, and I have helped you on the day of deliverance (the day of salvation). Behold, now is truly the time for a gracious welcome and acceptance [of you from God]; behold, now is the day of salvation!<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-28899A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-28900" class="sup">3</span>We put no obstruction in anybody's way [we give no offense in anything], so that no fault may be found and [our] ministry blamed and discredited.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28901" class="sup">4</span>But we commend ourselves in every way as [true] servants of God: through great endurance, in tribulation and suffering, in hardships and privations, in sore straits and calamities,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28902" class="sup">5</span>In beatings, imprisonments, riots, labors, sleepless watching, hunger;<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28903" class="sup">6</span>By innocence and purity, knowledge and spiritual insight, longsuffering and patience, kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in unfeigned love;<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28904" class="sup">7</span>By [speaking] the word of truth, in the power of God, with the weapons of righteousness for the right hand [to attack] and for the left hand [to defend];<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28905" class="sup">8</span>Amid honor and dishonor; in defaming and evil report and in praise and good report. [We are branded] as deceivers (impostors), and [yet vindicated as] truthful and honest.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28906" class="sup">9</span>[We are treated] as unknown and ignored [by the world], and [yet we are] well-known and recognized [by God and His people]; as dying, and yet here we are alive; as chastened by suffering and [yet] not killed;<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28907" class="sup">10</span>As grieved and mourning, yet [we are] always rejoicing; as poor [ourselves, yet] bestowing riches on many; as having nothing, and [yet in reality] possessing all things.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28908" class="sup">11</span>Our mouth is open to you, Corinthians [we are hiding nothing, keeping nothing back], and our heart is expanded wide [for you]!<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-28908B" title="See cross-reference B">B</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-28909" class="sup">12</span>There is no lack of room for you in [our hearts], but you lack room in your own affections [for us].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28910" class="sup">13</span>By way of return then, do this for me--I speak as to children--open wide your hearts also [to us].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28911" class="sup">14</span>Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers [do not make mismated alliances with them or come under a different yoke with them, inconsistent with your faith]. For what partnership have right living and right standing with God with iniquity and lawlessness? Or how can light have fellowship with darkness?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28912" class="sup">15</span>What harmony can there be between Christ and Belial [the devil]? Or what has a believer in common with an unbeliever?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28913" class="sup">16</span>What agreement [can there be between] a temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of the living God; even as God said, I will dwell in and with and among them and will walk in and with and among them, and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-28913C" title="See cross-reference C">C</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-28914" class="sup">17</span>So, come out from among [unbelievers], and separate (sever) yourselves from them, says the Lord, and touch not [any] unclean thing; then I will receive you kindly and treat you with favor,<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-28914D" title="See cross-reference D">D</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-28915" class="sup">18</span>And I will be a Father to you, and you shall be My sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-28915E" title="See cross-reference E">E</a>)</sup><p /> </p><p /><strong><br /><hr /><br /></strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-AMP-28898a"><a href="#en-AMP-28898" title="Go to 2 Corinthians 6:1">2 Corinthians 6:1</a> Joseph Thayer, A Greek-English Lexicon.</li>

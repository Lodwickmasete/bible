<p><h2>2 Corinthians 2</h2><span id="en-AMP-28824" class="sup">1</span>BUT I definitely made up my mind not to grieve you with another painful and distressing visit.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28825" class="sup">2</span>For if I cause you pain [with merited rebuke], who is there to provide me enjoyment but the [very] one whom I have grieved and made sad?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28826" class="sup">3</span>And I wrote the same to you so that when I came, I might not be myself pained by those who are the [very] ones who ought to make me glad, for I trusted in you all and felt confident that my joy would be shared by all of you.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28827" class="sup">4</span>For I wrote you out of great sorrow and deep distress [with mental torture and anxiety] of heart, [yes, and] with many tears, not to cause you pain but in order to make you realize the overflowing love that I continue increasingly to have for you.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28828" class="sup">5</span>But if someone [the one among you who committed incest] has caused [all this] grief and pain, he has caused it not to me, but in some measure, not to put it too severely, [he has distressed] all of you.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28829" class="sup">6</span>For such a one this censure by the majority [which he has received is] sufficient [punishment].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28830" class="sup">7</span>So [instead of further rebuke, now] you should rather turn and [graciously] forgive and comfort and encourage [him], to keep him from being overwhelmed by excessive sorrow and despair.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28831" class="sup">8</span>I therefore beg you to reinstate him in your affections and assure him of your love for him;<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28832" class="sup">9</span>For this was my purpose in writing you, to test your attitude and see if you would stand the test, whether you are obedient and altogether agreeable [to following my orders] in everything.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28833" class="sup">10</span>If you forgive anyone anything, I too forgive that one; and what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, has been for your sakes in the presence [and with the approval] of Christ (the Messiah),<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28834" class="sup">11</span>To keep Satan from getting the advantage over us; for we are not ignorant of his wiles and intentions.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28835" class="sup">12</span>Now when I arrived at Troas [to preach] the good news (the Gospel) of Christ, a door of opportunity was opened for me in the Lord,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28836" class="sup">13</span>Yet my spirit could not rest (relax, get relief) because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I took leave from them and departed for Macedonia.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28837" class="sup">14</span>But thanks be to God, Who in Christ always leads us in triumph [as trophies of Christ's victory] and through us spreads and makes evident the fragrance of the knowledge of God everywhere,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28838" class="sup">15</span>For we are the sweet fragrance of Christ [which exhales] unto God, [discernible alike] among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing:<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28839" class="sup">16</span>To the latter it is an aroma [wafted] from death to death [a fatal odor, the smell of doom]; to the former it is an aroma from life to life [a vital fragrance, living and fresh]. And who is qualified (fit and sufficient) for these things? [Who is able for such a ministry? We?]<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28840" class="sup">17</span>For we are not, like so many, [like hucksters making a trade of] peddling God's Word [shortchanging and adulterating the divine message]; but like [men] of sincerity and the purest motive, as [commissioned and sent] by God, we speak [His message] in Christ (the Messiah), in the [very] sight and presence of God.<p /> </p><p /><br /></div>

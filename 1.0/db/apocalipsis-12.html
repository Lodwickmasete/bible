<p><h2>Revelation 12</h2><span id="en-AMP-30892" class="sup">1</span>AND A great sign (wonder)--[warning of future events of ominous significance] appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and with a crownlike garland (tiara) of twelve stars on her head.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30893" class="sup">2</span>She was pregnant and she cried out in her birth pangs, in the anguish of her delivery.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30894" class="sup">3</span>Then another ominous sign (wonder) was seen in heaven: Behold, a huge, fiery-red dragon, with seven heads and ten horns, and seven kingly crowns (diadems) upon his heads.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30894A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30895" class="sup">4</span>His tail swept [across the sky] and dragged down a third of the stars and flung them to the earth. And the dragon stationed himself in front of the woman who was about to be delivered, so that he might devour her child as soon as she brought it forth.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30895B" title="See cross-reference B">B</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30896" class="sup">5</span>And she brought forth a male Child, One Who is destined to shepherd (rule) all the nations with an iron staff (scepter), and her Child was caught up to God and to His throne.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30896C" title="See cross-reference C">C</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30897" class="sup">6</span>And the woman [herself] fled into the desert (wilderness), where she has a retreat prepared [for her] by God, in which she is to be fed and kept safe for 1,260 days (42 months; three and one-half years).<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30898" class="sup">7</span>Then war broke out in heaven; Michael and his angels went forth to battle with the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30899" class="sup">8</span>But they were defeated, and there was no room found for them in heaven any longer.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30900" class="sup">9</span>And the huge dragon was cast down and out--that age-old serpent, who is called the Devil and Satan, he who is the seducer (deceiver) of all humanity the world over; he was forced out and down to the earth, and his angels were flung out along with him.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30900D" title="See cross-reference D">D</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30901" class="sup">10</span>Then I heard a strong (loud) voice in heaven, saying, Now it has come--the salvation and the power and the kingdom (the dominion, the reign) of our God, and the power (the sovereignty, the authority) of His Christ (the Messiah); for the accuser of our brethren, he who keeps bringing before our God charges against them day and night, has been cast out!<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30901E" title="See cross-reference E">E</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30902" class="sup">11</span>And they have overcome (conquered) him by means of the blood of the Lamb and by the utterance of their testimony, for they did not love and cling to life even when faced with death [holding their lives cheap till they had to die for their witnessing].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30903" class="sup">12</span>Therefore be glad (exult), O heavens and you that dwell in them! But woe to you, O earth and sea, for the devil has come down to you in fierce anger (fury), because he knows that he has [only] a short time [left]!<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30903F" title="See cross-reference F">F</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30904" class="sup">13</span>And when the dragon saw that he was cast down to the earth, he went in pursuit of the woman who had given birth to the male Child.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30905" class="sup">14</span>But the woman was supplied with the two wings of a giant eagle, so that she might fly from the presence of the serpent into the desert (wilderness), to the retreat where she is to be kept safe and fed for a time, and times, and half a time (three and one-half years, or 1,260 days).<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30905G" title="See cross-reference G">G</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30906" class="sup">15</span>Then out of his mouth the serpent spouted forth water like a flood after the woman, that she might be carried off with the torrent.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30907" class="sup">16</span>But the earth came to the rescue of the woman, and the ground opened its mouth and swallowed up the stream of water which the dragon had spouted from his mouth.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30908" class="sup">17</span>So then the dragon was furious (enraged) at the woman, and he went away to wage war on the remainder of her descendants--[on those] who obey God's commandments and who have the testimony of Jesus Christ [and adhere to it and <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30908a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>bear witness to Him].<p /> </p><p /><strong><br /><hr /><br /></strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-AMP-30908a"><a href="#en-AMP-30908" title="Go to Revelation 12:17">Revelation 12:17</a> Charles B.

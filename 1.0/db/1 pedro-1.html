<p><h2>1 Peter 1</h2><span id="en-AMP-30374" class="sup">1</span>PETER, AN apostle (a special messenger) of Jesus Christ, [writing] to the elect exiles of the dispersion scattered (sowed) abroad in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30375" class="sup">2</span>Who were chosen and foreknown by God the Father and consecrated (sanctified, made holy) by the Spirit to be obedient to Jesus Christ (the Messiah) and to be sprinkled with [His] blood: May grace (spiritual blessing) and peace be given you in increasing abundance [that spiritual peace to be <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30375a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>realized in and through Christ, <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30375b" title=" b">b</a>]</sup>freedom from fears, agitating passions, and moral conflicts].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30376" class="sup">3</span>Praised (honored, blessed) be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah)! By His boundless mercy we have been born again to an ever-living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30377" class="sup">4</span>[Born anew] into an inheritance which is beyond the reach of change and decay [imperishable], unsullied and unfading, reserved in heaven for you,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30378" class="sup">5</span>Who are being guarded (garrisoned) by God's power through [your] faith [till you fully inherit that <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30378c" title=" c">c</a>]</sup>final] salvation that is ready to be revealed [for you] in the last time.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30379" class="sup">6</span>[You should] be exceedingly glad on this account, though now for a little while you may be distressed by trials and suffer temptations,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30380" class="sup">7</span>So that [the genuineness] of your faith may be tested, [your faith] which is infinitely more precious than the perishable gold which is tested and purified by fire. [This proving of your faith is intended] to redound to [your] praise and glory and honor when Jesus Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One) is revealed.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30381" class="sup">8</span>Without having seen Him, you love Him; though you do not [even] now see Him, you believe in Him and exult and thrill with inexpressible and glorious (triumphant, heavenly) joy.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30382" class="sup">9</span>[At the same time] you receive the result (outcome, consummation) of your faith, the salvation of your souls.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30383" class="sup">10</span>The prophets, who prophesied of the grace (divine blessing) which was intended for you, searched and inquired earnestly about this salvation.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30384" class="sup">11</span>They sought [to find out] to whom or when this was to come which the Spirit of Christ working within them was indicating when He predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories that should follow [them].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30385" class="sup">12</span>It was then disclosed to them that the services they were rendering were not meant for themselves and their period of time, but for you. [It is these very] things which have now already been made known plainly to you by those who preached the good news (the Gospel) to you by the [same] Holy Spirit sent from heaven. Into these things [the very] angels long to look!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30386" class="sup">13</span>So brace up your minds; be sober (circumspect, morally alert); set your hope wholly and unchangeably on the grace (divine favor) that is coming to you when Jesus Christ (the Messiah) is revealed.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30387" class="sup">14</span>[Live] as children of obedience [to God]; do not conform yourselves to the evil desires [that governed you] in your former ignorance [when you did not know the requirements of the Gospel].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30388" class="sup">15</span>But as the One Who called you is holy, you yourselves also be holy in all your conduct and manner of living.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30389" class="sup">16</span>For it is written, You shall be holy, for I am holy.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30389A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30390" class="sup">17</span>And if you call upon Him as [your] Father Who judges each one impartially according to what he does, [then] you should conduct yourselves with true reverence throughout the time of your temporary residence [on the earth, whether long or short].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30391" class="sup">18</span>You must know (recognize) that you were redeemed (ransomed) from the useless (fruitless) way of living inherited by tradition from [your] forefathers, not with corruptible things [such as] silver and gold,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30392" class="sup">19</span>But [you were purchased] with the precious blood of Christ (the Messiah), like that of a [sacrificial] lamb without blemish or spot.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30393" class="sup">20</span>It is true that He was chosen and foreordained (destined and foreknown for it) before the foundation of the world, but He was brought out to public view (made manifest) in these last days (at the end of the times) for the sake of you.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30394" class="sup">21</span>Through Him you believe in (adhere to, rely on) God, Who raised Him up from the dead and gave Him honor and glory, so that your faith and hope are [centered and rest] in God.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30395" class="sup">22</span>Since by your obedience to the Truth through the [Holy ] Spirit you have purified your hearts for the sincere affection of the brethren, [see that you] love one another fervently from a pure heart.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30396" class="sup">23</span>You have been regenerated (born again), not from a mortal <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30396d" title=" d">d</a>]</sup>origin (<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30396e" title=" e">e</a>]</sup>seed, sperm), but from one that is immortal by the ever living and lasting Word of God.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30397" class="sup">24</span>For all flesh (mankind) is like grass, and all its glory (honor) like [the] flower of grass. The grass withers and the flower drops off,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30398" class="sup">25</span>But the Word of the Lord (<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30398f" title=" f">f</a>]</sup>divine instruction, the Gospel) endures forever.

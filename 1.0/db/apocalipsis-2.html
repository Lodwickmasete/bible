<p><h2>Revelation 2</h2><span id="en-AMP-30718" class="sup">1</span>TO THE angel (messenger) of the assembly (church) in Ephesus write: These are the words of Him Who holds the seven stars [which are the messengers of the seven churches] in His right hand, Who goes about among the seven golden lampstands [which are the seven churches]:<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30719" class="sup">2</span>I know your industry and activities, laborious toil and trouble, and your patient endurance, and how you cannot tolerate wicked [men] and have tested and critically appraised those who call [themselves] apostles (special messengers of Christ) and yet are not, and have found them to be impostors and liars.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30720" class="sup">3</span>I know you are enduring patiently and are bearing up for My name's sake, and you have not fainted or become exhausted or grown weary.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30721" class="sup">4</span>But I have this [one charge to make] against you: that you have left (abandoned) the love that you had at first [you have deserted Me, your first love].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30722" class="sup">5</span>Remember then from what heights you have fallen. Repent (change the inner man to meet God's will) and do the works you did previously [when first you knew the Lord], or else I will visit you and remove your lampstand from its place, unless you change your mind and repent.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30723" class="sup">6</span>Yet you have this [in your favor and to your credit]: you hate the works of the Nicolaitans [what they are doing as corrupters of the people], which I Myself also detest.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30724" class="sup">7</span>He who is able to hear, let him listen to and give heed to what the Spirit says to the assemblies (churches). To him who overcomes (is victorious), I will grant to eat [of the fruit] of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30724A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30725" class="sup">8</span>And to the angel (messenger) of the assembly (church) in Smyrna write: These are the words of the First and the Last, Who died and came to life again:<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30725B" title="See cross-reference B">B</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30726" class="sup">9</span>I know your affliction and distress and pressing trouble and your poverty--but you are rich! and how you are abused and reviled and slandered by those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30727" class="sup">10</span>Fear nothing that you are about to suffer. [Dismiss your dread and your fears!] Behold, the devil is indeed about to throw some of you into prison, that you may be tested and proved and critically appraised, and for ten days you will have affliction. Be loyally faithful unto death [even if you must die for it], and I will give you the crown of life.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30727C" title="See cross-reference C">C</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30728" class="sup">11</span>He who is able to hear, let him listen to and heed what the Spirit says to the assemblies (churches). He who overcomes (is victorious) shall in no way be injured by the second death.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30729" class="sup">12</span>Then to the angel (messenger) of the assembly (church) in Pergamum write: These are the words of Him Who has and wields the sharp two-edged sword:<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30730" class="sup">13</span>I know where you live--a place where Satan sits enthroned. [Yet] you are clinging to and holding fast My name, and you did not deny My faith, even in the days of Antipas, My witness, My faithful one, who was killed (martyred) in your midst--where Satan dwells.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30731" class="sup">14</span>Nevertheless, I have a few things against you: you have some people there who are clinging to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to set a trap and a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, [to entice them] to eat food that had been sacrificed to idols and to practice lewdness [giving themselves up to sexual vice].<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30731D" title="See cross-reference D">D</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30732" class="sup">15</span>You also have some who in a similar way are clinging to the teaching of the Nicolaitans [those corrupters of the people] which thing I hate.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30733" class="sup">16</span>Repent [then]! Or else I will come to you quickly and fight against them with the sword of My mouth.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30734" class="sup">17</span>He who is able to hear, let him listen to and heed what the Spirit says to the assemblies (churches). To him who overcomes (conquers), I will give to eat of the manna that is hidden, and I will give him a white stone with a new name engraved on the stone, which no one knows or understands except he who receives it.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30734E" title="See cross-reference E">E</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30735" class="sup">18</span>And to the angel (messenger) of the assembly (church) in Thyatira write: These are the words of the Son of God, Who has eyes that flash like a flame of fire, and Whose feet glow like bright and burnished and white-hot bronze:<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30735F" title="See cross-reference F">F</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30736" class="sup">19</span>I know your record and what you are doing, your love and faith and service and patient endurance, and that your recent works are more numerous and greater than your first ones.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30737" class="sup">20</span>But I have this against you: that you tolerate the woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess [claiming to be inspired], and who is teaching and leading astray my servants and beguiling them into practicing sexual vice and eating food sacrificed to idols. [I Kings 16:31; II Kings 9:22, 30.]<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30738" class="sup">21</span>I gave her time to repent, but she has no desire to repent of her immorality [symbolic of idolatry] and refuses to do so.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30739" class="sup">22</span>Take note: I will throw her on a bed [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30739a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>of anguish], and those who commit adultery with her [her paramours] I will bring down to <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30739b" title=" b">b</a>]</sup>pressing distress and severe affliction, unless they turn away their minds from conduct [such as] hers and repent of <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30739c" title=" c">c</a>]</sup>their doings.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30740" class="sup">23</span>And I will strike her children (her proper followers) dead [thoroughly exterminating them]. And all the assemblies (churches) shall recognize and understand that I am He Who searches minds (the thoughts, feelings, and purposes) and the [inmost] hearts, and I will give to each of you [the reward for what you have done] as your work deserves.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30740G" title="See cross-reference G">G</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30741" class="sup">24</span>But to the rest of you in Thyatira, who do not hold this teaching, who have not explored and known the depths of Satan, as they say--I tell you that I do not lay upon you any other [fresh] burden:<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30742" class="sup">25</span>Only hold fast to what you have until I come.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30743" class="sup">26</span>And he who overcomes (is victorious) and who obeys My commands to the [very] end [doing the works that please Me], I will give him authority and power over the nations;<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30744" class="sup">27</span>And he shall rule them with a sceptre (rod) of iron, as when earthen pots are broken in pieces, and [his power over them shall be] like that which I Myself have received from My Father;<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-30744H" title="See cross-reference H">H</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-30745" class="sup">28</span>And I will give him the Morning Star.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30746" class="sup">29</span>He who is able to hear, let him listen to and heed what the [Holy] Spirit says to the assemblies (churches).<p /> </p><p /><strong><br /><hr /><br /></strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-AMP-30739a"><a href="#en-AMP-30739" title="Go to Revelation 2:22">Revelation 2:22</a> Marvin Vincent, Word Studies.</li>

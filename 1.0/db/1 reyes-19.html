<p><h2>1 Kings 19</h2><span id="en-AMP-9389" class="sup">1</span>AHAB TOLD Jezebel all that Elijah had done and how he had slain all the prophets [of Baal] with the sword.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9390" class="sup">2</span>Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if I make not your life as the life of one of them by this time tomorrow.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9391" class="sup">3</span>Then he was afraid and arose and went for his life and came to Beersheba of Judah [over eighty miles, and out of Jezebel's realm] and left his servant there.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9392" class="sup">4</span>But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a lone broom or juniper tree and asked that he might die. He said, It is enough; now, O Lord, take away my life; for I am no better than my fathers.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9393" class="sup">5</span>As he lay asleep under the broom or juniper tree, behold, an angel touched him and said to him, Arise and eat.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9394" class="sup">6</span>He looked, and behold, there was a cake baked on the coals, and a bottle of water at his head. And he ate and drank and lay down again.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9395" class="sup">7</span>The angel of the Lord came the second time and touched him and said, Arise and eat, for the journey is too great for you.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9396" class="sup">8</span>So he arose and ate and drank, and went in the strength of that food forty days and nights to Horeb, the mount of God.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9397" class="sup">9</span>There he came to a cave and lodged in it; and behold, the word of the Lord came to him, and He said to him, What are you doing here, Elijah?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9398" class="sup">10</span>He replied, I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts; for the Israelites have forsaken Your covenant, thrown down Your altars, and killed Your prophets with the sword. And I, I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9399" class="sup">11</span>And He said, Go out and stand on the mount before the Lord. And behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains and broke in pieces the rocks before the Lord, but the Lord was not in the wind; and after the wind an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake;<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9400" class="sup">12</span>And after the earthquake a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire; and after the fire [a sound of gentle stillness and] a still, small voice.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9401" class="sup">13</span>When Elijah heard the voice, he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the entrance of the cave. And behold, there came a voice to him and said, What are you doing here, Elijah?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9402" class="sup">14</span>He said, I have been very jealous for the Lord God of hosts, because the Israelites have forsaken Your covenant, thrown down Your altars, and slain Your prophets with the sword. And I, I only, am left, and they seek my life, to destroy it.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9403" class="sup">15</span>And the Lord said to him, Go, return on your way to the Wilderness of Damascus; and when you arrive, anoint Hazael to be king over Syria.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9404" class="sup">16</span>And anoint Jehu son of Nimshi to be king over Israel, and anoint Elisha son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah to be prophet in your place.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9405" class="sup">17</span>And him who escapes from the sword of <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-9405a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>Hazael Jehu shall slay, and him who escapes the sword of Jehu Elisha shall slay.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9406" class="sup">18</span>Yet I will leave Myself 7,000 in Israel, all the knees that have not bowed to Baal and every mouth that has not kissed him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9407" class="sup">19</span>So Elijah left there and found Elisha son of Shaphat, whose plowing was being done with twelve yoke of oxen, and he drove the twelfth. Elijah crossed over to him and cast his mantle upon him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9408" class="sup">20</span>He left the oxen and ran after Elijah and said, Let me kiss my father and mother, and then I will follow you. And he [testing Elisha] said, Go on back. What have I done to you? [Settle it for yourself.]<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9409" class="sup">21</span>So Elisha went back from him. Then he took a yoke of oxen, slew them, boiled their flesh with the oxen's yoke [as fuel], and gave to the people, and they ate. Then he arose, followed Elijah, and served him.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-9409A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p /> </p><p /><strong><br /><hr /><br /></strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-AMP-9405a"><a href="#en-AMP-9405" title="Go to 1 Kings 19:17">1 Kings 19:17</a> Ahab had again fallen under the sway of Jezebel. Therefore, Baal worship would recover from the blow dealt it by Elijah. Elijah is accordingly instructed to take the necessary steps for the destruction of Baal worship. They were three. First, Ahab was to be attacked from without by the Syrians, and for that purpose warlike Hazael was to take the Syrian throne. Second, when Ahab was thus weakened, Jehu was to seize his throne, since Jehu was a known opponent of Baal worship, and also a ruthless soldier. Third, Elijah was to appoint as his own successor the vigorous and wholehearted Elisha, who might be trusted under Jehu to complete the destruction of the adherents of Baal (The Cambridge Bible).</li>

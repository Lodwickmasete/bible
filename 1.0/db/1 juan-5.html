<p><h2>1 John 5</h2><span id="en-AMP-30624" class="sup">1</span>EVERYONE WHO believes (adheres to, trusts, and relies on the fact) that Jesus is the Christ (the Messiah) is a born-again child of God; and everyone who loves the Father also loves the one born of Him (His offspring).<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30625" class="sup">2</span>By this we come to know (recognize and understand) that we love the children of God: when we love God and obey His commands (orders, charges)--[when we keep His ordinances and are mindful of His precepts and His teaching].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30626" class="sup">3</span>For the [true] love of God is this: that we do His commands [keep His ordinances and are mindful of His precepts and teaching]. And these orders of His are not irksome (burdensome, oppressive, or grievous).<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30627" class="sup">4</span>For whatever is born of God is victorious over the world; and this is the victory that conquers the world, even our faith.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30628" class="sup">5</span>Who is it that is victorious over [that conquers] the world but he who believes that Jesus is the Son of God [who adheres to, trusts in, and relies on that fact]?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30629" class="sup">6</span>This is He Who came by (with) water and blood [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30629a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>His baptism and His death], Jesus Christ (the Messiah)--not by (in) the water only, but by (in) the water and the blood. And it is the [Holy] Spirit Who bears witness, because the [Holy] Spirit is the Truth.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30630" class="sup">7</span>So there are three witnesses <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30630b" title=" b">b</a>]</sup>in heaven: the Father, the Word and the Holy Spirit, and these three are One;<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30631" class="sup">8</span>and there are three witnesses on the earth: the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and these three agree [are in unison; their testimony coincides].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30632" class="sup">9</span>If we accept [as we do] the testimony of men [if we are willing to take human authority], the testimony of God is greater (of stronger authority), for this is the testimony of God, even the witness which He has borne regarding His Son.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30633" class="sup">10</span>He who believes in the Son of God [who adheres to, trusts in, and relies on Him] has the testimony [possesses this divine attestation] within himself. He who does not believe God [in this way] has made Him out to be and represented Him as a liar, because he has not believed (put his faith in, adhered to, and relied on) the evidence (the testimony) that God has borne regarding His Son.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30634" class="sup">11</span>And this is that testimony (that evidence): God gave us eternal life, and this life is in His Son.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30635" class="sup">12</span>He who possesses the Son has that life; he who does not possess the Son of God does not have that life.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30636" class="sup">13</span>I write this to you who believe in (adhere to, trust in, and rely on) the name of the Son of God [in <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30636c" title=" c">c</a>]</sup>the peculiar services and blessings conferred by Him on men], so that you may know [with settled and absolute knowledge] that you [already] have life, <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-30636d" title=" d">d</a>]</sup>yes, eternal life.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30637" class="sup">14</span>And this is the confidence (the assurance, the privilege of boldness) which we have in Him: [we are sure] that if we ask anything (make any request) according to His will (in agreement with His own plan), He listens to and hears us.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30638" class="sup">15</span>And if (since) we [positively] know that He listens to us in whatever we ask, we also know [with settled and absolute knowledge] that we have [granted us as our present possessions] the requests made of Him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30639" class="sup">16</span>If anyone sees his brother [believer] committing a sin that does not [lead to] death (the extinguishing of life), he will pray and [God] will give him life [yes, He will grant life to all those whose sin is not one leading to death]. There is a sin [that leads] to death; I do not say that one should pray for that.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30640" class="sup">17</span>All wrongdoing is sin, and there is sin which does not [involve] death [that may be repented of and forgiven].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30641" class="sup">18</span>We know [absolutely] that anyone born of God does not [deliberately and knowingly] practice committing sin, but the One Who was begotten of God carefully watches over and protects him [Christ's divine presence within him preserves him against the evil], and the wicked one does not lay hold (get a grip) on him or touch [him].<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30642" class="sup">19</span>We know [positively] that we are of God, and the whole world [around us] is under the power of the evil one.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30643" class="sup">20</span>And we [have seen and] know [positively] that the Son of God has [actually] come to this world and has given us understanding and insight [progressively] to perceive (recognize) and come to know better and more clearly Him Who is true; and we are in Him Who is true--in His Son Jesus Christ (the Messiah). This [Man] is the true God and Life eternal.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-30644" class="sup">21</span>Little children, keep yourselves from idols (false gods)--[from anything and everything that would occupy the place in your heart due to God, from any sort of substitute for Him that would take first place in your life]. Amen (so let it be). </p><p /><strong><br /><hr /><br /></strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-AMP-30629a"><a href="#en-AMP-30629" title="Go to 1 John 5:6">1 John 5:6</a> Marvin Vincent, Word Studies.</li>

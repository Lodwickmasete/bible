<p><h2>2 Samuel 9</h2><span id="en-AMP-8229" class="sup">1</span>AND DAVID said, Is there still anyone left of the house of Saul to whom I may show kindness for Jonathan's sake?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8230" class="sup">2</span>And of the house of Saul there was a servant whose name was Ziba. When they had called him to David, he said to him, Are you Ziba? He said, I, your servant, am he.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8231" class="sup">3</span>The king said, Is there not still someone of the house of Saul to whom I may show the [unfailing, unsought, unlimited] mercy and kindness of God? Ziba replied, Jonathan has yet a son who is lame in his feet.<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-8231A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-8232" class="sup">4</span>And the king said, Where is he? Ziba replied, He is in the house of Machir son of Ammiel in Lo-debar.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8233" class="sup">5</span>Then King David sent and brought him from the house of Machir son of Ammiel at Lo-debar.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8234" class="sup">6</span>And Mephibosheth son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came to David and fell on his face and did obeisance. David said, Mephibosheth! And he answered, Behold your servant!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8235" class="sup">7</span>David said to him, Fear not, for I will surely show you kindness for Jonathan your father's sake, and will restore to you all the land of Saul your father [grandfather], and you shall eat at my table always.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8236" class="sup">8</span>And [the cripple] bowed himself and said, What is your servant, that you should look upon such a dead dog as I am?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8237" class="sup">9</span>Then the king called to Ziba, Saul's servant, and said to him, I have given your master's son [grandson] all that belonged to Saul and to all his house.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8238" class="sup">10</span>And you shall till the land for him, you, your sons, and your servants, and you shall bring in the produce, that your master's heir may have food to eat; but Mephibosheth, your master's son [grandson], shall eat always at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8239" class="sup">11</span>Then Ziba said to the king, Your servant will do according to all my lord the king commands. So Mephibosheth ate at David's table as one of the king's sons.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8240" class="sup">12</span>Mephibosheth had a young son whose name was Micha. And all who dwelt in Ziba's house were servants to Mephibosheth.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8241" class="sup">13</span>So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem, for he ate continually at the king's table, [even though] he was lame in both feet.<p /> </p><p /><strong>Cross references:</strong><ol type="A"><li id="cen-AMP-8231A"><a href="#en-AMP-8231" title="Go to 2 Samuel 9:3">2 Samuel 9:3</a> :  Sam 20:14-17 </li>

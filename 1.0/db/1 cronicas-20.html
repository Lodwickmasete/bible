<p><h2>1 Chronicles 20</h2><span id="en-AMP-10928" class="sup">1</span>AFTER THE end of the year, when kings go out to battle, Joab led forth the army and devastated the land of the Ammonites, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. Joab smote Rabbah and overthrew it.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10929" class="sup">2</span>David took their king's crown from off his head and found that it weighed a talent of gold and that precious stones were in it. It was set upon David's head. He brought also very much spoil out of the city of Rabbah.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10930" class="sup">3</span>He brought out the people who were in it and set them at cutting with saws, iron wedges, and axes. So David dealt with all the Ammonite cities. And David and all the army returned to Jerusalem.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10931" class="sup">4</span>After this, there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines; then Sibbecai the Hushathite slew Sippai, of the sons of the giant, and they were subdued.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10932" class="sup">5</span>There was war again with the Philistines, and Elhanan son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver's beam.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10933" class="sup">6</span>And again there was war at Gath, where was a man of great stature who had twenty-four fingers and toes, six on each hand and each foot. He also was born to the giant.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10934" class="sup">7</span>And when he reproached and defied Israel, Jonathan son of Shimea, David's brother, slew him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10935" class="sup">8</span>These were born to the giant [clan] in Gath, and they fell by the hands of David and his servants.<p /> </p><p /><br /></div>

<p><h2>2 Corinthians 4</h2><span id="en-AMP-28859" class="sup">1</span>THEREFORE, SINCE we do hold and engage in this ministry by the mercy of God [granting us favor, benefits, opportunities, and especially salvation], we do not get discouraged (spiritless and despondent with fear) or become faint with weariness and exhaustion.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28860" class="sup">2</span>We have renounced disgraceful ways (secret thoughts, feelings, desires and underhandedness, the methods and arts that men hide through shame); we refuse to deal craftily (to practice trickery and cunning) or to adulterate or handle dishonestly the Word of God, but we state the truth openly (clearly and candidly). And so we commend ourselves in the sight and presence of God to every man's conscience.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28861" class="sup">3</span>But even if our Gospel (the glad tidings) also be hidden (obscured and covered up with a veil that hinders the knowledge of God), it is hidden [only] to those who are perishing and obscured [only] to those who are spiritually dying and veiled [only] to those who are lost.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28862" class="sup">4</span>For the god of this world has blinded the unbelievers' minds [that they should not discern the truth], preventing them from seeing the illuminating light of the Gospel of the glory of Christ (the Messiah), Who is the Image and Likeness of God.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28863" class="sup">5</span>For what we preach is not ourselves but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves [merely] as your servants (slaves) for Jesus' sake.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28864" class="sup">6</span>For God Who said, Let light shine out of darkness, has shone in our hearts so as [to beam forth] the Light for the illumination of the knowledge of the majesty and glory of God [as it is manifest in the Person and is revealed] in the face of Jesus Christ (the Messiah).<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-28864A" title="See cross-reference A">A</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-28865" class="sup">7</span>However, we possess this precious treasure [the divine Light of the Gospel] in [frail, human] vessels of earth, that the grandeur and exceeding greatness of the power may be shown to be from God and not from ourselves.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28866" class="sup">8</span>We are hedged in (pressed) on every side [troubled and oppressed in every way], but not cramped or crushed; we suffer embarrassments and are perplexed and unable to find a way out, but not driven to despair;<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28867" class="sup">9</span>We are pursued (persecuted and hard driven), but not deserted [to stand alone]; we are struck down to the ground, but never struck out and destroyed;<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28868" class="sup">10</span>Always carrying about in the body the liability and exposure to the same putting to death that the Lord Jesus suffered, so that the [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28868a" title=" a">a</a>]</sup>resurrection] life of Jesus also may be shown forth by and in our bodies.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28869" class="sup">11</span>For we who live are constantly [experiencing] being handed over to death for Jesus' sake, that the [<sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28869b" title=" b">b</a>]</sup>resurrection] life of Jesus also may be evidenced through our flesh which is liable to death.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28870" class="sup">12</span>Thus death is actively at work in us, but [it is in order that <sup>[<a href="#fen-AMP-28870c" title=" c">c</a>]</sup>our] life [may be actively at work] in you.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28871" class="sup">13</span>Yet we have the same spirit of faith as he had who wrote, I have believed, and therefore have I spoken. We too believe, and therefore we speak,<sup>(<a href="#cen-AMP-28871B" title="See cross-reference B">B</a>)</sup><p />  <span id="en-AMP-28872" class="sup">14</span>Assured that He Who raised up the Lord Jesus will raise us up also with Jesus and bring us [along] with you into His presence.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28873" class="sup">15</span>For all [these] things are [taking place] for your sake, so that the more grace (divine favor and spiritual blessing) extends to more and more people and multiplies through the many, the more thanksgiving may increase [and redound] to the glory of God.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28874" class="sup">16</span>Therefore we do not become discouraged (utterly spiritless, exhausted, and wearied out through fear). Though our outer man is [progressively] decaying and wasting away, yet our inner self is being [progressively] renewed day after day.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28875" class="sup">17</span>For our light, momentary affliction (this slight distress of the passing hour) is ever more and more abundantly preparing and producing and achieving for us an everlasting weight of glory [beyond all measure, excessively surpassing all comparisons and all calculations, a vast and transcendent glory and blessedness never to cease!],<p />  <span id="en-AMP-28876" class="sup">18</span>Since we consider and look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen; for the things that are visible are temporal (brief and fleeting), but the things that are invisible are deathless and everlasting.<p /> </p><p /><strong><br /><hr /><br /></strong><ol type="a"><li id="fen-AMP-28868a"><a href="#en-AMP-28868" title="Go to 2 Corinthians 4:10">2 Corinthians 4:10</a> Marvin Vincent, Word Studies.</li>

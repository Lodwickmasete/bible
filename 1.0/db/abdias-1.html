<p><h2>Obadiah 1</h2><span id="en-AMP-22512" class="sup">1</span>THE VISION of Obadiah.

If grape gatherers came to you, would they not leave some grapes for gleaning?

It included the city of Petra. The country of Moab formed Edom's boundary on the north, and the descendants of Esau constituted its population. Edom and Moab have a remarkably prominent place in prophecy as "the scene of the final destruction of Gentile world power in the day of the Lord," as revealed in the Scripture references accompanying Obad. 1 (which are important for the full, vivid picture of what lies ahead for the nations of the world).</li>

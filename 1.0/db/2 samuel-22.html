People whom I had not known served me.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8648" class="sup">45</span>Foreigners yielded feigned obedience to me; as soon as they heard of me, they became obedient to me.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8649" class="sup">46</span>Foreigners faded away; they came limping and trembling from their strongholds.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8650" class="sup">47</span>The Lord lives; blessed be my Rock, and exalted be God, the Rock of my salvation.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8651" class="sup">48</span>It is God Who executes vengeance for me and Who brought down [and disciplined] the peoples under me,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8652" class="sup">49</span>Who brought me out from my enemies. You also lifted me up above those who rose up against me; You delivered me from the violent man.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8653" class="sup">50</span>For this I will give thanks and extol You, O Lord, among the nations; I will sing praises to Your name.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-8654" class="sup">51</span>He is a Tower of salvation and great deliverance to His king, and shows loving-kindness to His anointed, to David and his offspring forever.<p /> </p><p /><strong>Cross references:</strong><ol type="A"><li id="cen-AMP-8605A"><a href="#en-AMP-8605" title="Go to 2 Samuel 22:2">2 Samuel 22:2</a> :  Sam 23:14, 25, 28 </li>

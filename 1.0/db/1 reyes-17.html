<p><h2>1 Kings 17</h2><span id="en-AMP-9319" class="sup">1</span>ELIJAH THE Tishbite, of the temporary residents of Gilead, said to Ahab, As the Lord, the God of Israel, lives, before Whom I stand, there shall not be dew or rain these years but according to My word.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9320" class="sup">2</span>And the word of the Lord came to him, saying,<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9321" class="sup">3</span>Go from here and turn east and hide yourself by the brook Cherith, east of the Jordan.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9322" class="sup">4</span>You shall drink of the brook, and I have commanded the ravens to feed you there.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9323" class="sup">5</span>So he did according to the word of the Lord; he went and dwelt by the brook Cherith, east of the Jordan.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9324" class="sup">6</span>And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning and bread and flesh in the evening, and he drank of the brook.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9325" class="sup">7</span>After a while the brook dried up because there was no rain in the land.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9326" class="sup">8</span>And the word of the Lord came to him:<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9327" class="sup">9</span>Arise, go to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon, and dwell there. Behold, I have commanded a widow there to provide for you.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9328" class="sup">10</span>So he arose and went to Zarephath. When he came to the gate of the city, behold, a widow was there gathering sticks. He called to her, Bring me a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9329" class="sup">11</span>As she was going to get it, he called to her and said, Bring me a morsel of bread in your hand.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9330" class="sup">12</span>And she said, As the Lord your God lives, I have not a loaf baked but only a handful of meal in the jar and a little oil in the bottle. See, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and bake it for me and my son, that we may eat it--and die.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9331" class="sup">13</span>Elijah said to her, Fear not; go and do as you have said. But make me a little cake of [it] first and bring it to me, and afterward prepare some for yourself and your son.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9332" class="sup">14</span>For thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: The jar of meal shall not waste away or the bottle of oil fail until the day that the Lord sends rain on the earth.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9333" class="sup">15</span>She did as Elijah said. And she and he and her household ate for many days.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9334" class="sup">16</span>The jar of meal was not spent nor did the bottle of oil fail, according to the word which the Lord spoke through Elijah.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9335" class="sup">17</span>After these things, the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, became sick; and his sickness was so severe that there was no breath left in him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9336" class="sup">18</span>And she said to Elijah, What have you against me, O man of God? Have you come to me to call my sin to remembrance and to slay my son?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9337" class="sup">19</span>He said to her, Give me your son. And he took him from her bosom and carried him up into the chamber where he stayed and laid him upon his own bed.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9338" class="sup">20</span>And Elijah cried to the Lord and said, O Lord my God, have You brought further calamity upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying her son?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9339" class="sup">21</span>And he stretched himself upon the child three times and cried to the Lord and said, O Lord my God, I pray You, let this child's soul come back into him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9340" class="sup">22</span>And the Lord heard the voice of Elijah, and the soul of the child came into him again, and he revived.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9341" class="sup">23</span>And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of the chamber into the [lower part of the] house and gave him to his mother; and Elijah said, See, your son is alive!<p />  <span id="en-AMP-9342" class="sup">24</span>And the woman said to Elijah, By this I know that you are a man of God and that the word of the Lord in your mouth is truth.<p /> </p><p /><br /></div>

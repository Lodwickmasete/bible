<p><h2>1 Chronicles 19</h2><span id="en-AMP-10909" class="sup">1</span>AFTER THIS, Nahash king of the Ammonites died, and his son reigned in his stead.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10910" class="sup">2</span>David said, I will show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me. And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father's death. So the servants of David came into the land of the Ammonites to comfort Hanun.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10911" class="sup">3</span>But the princes of the Ammonites said to Hanun, Do you think that David has sent comforters to you because he honors your father? Have his servants not come to you to search, to overthrow, and to spy out the land?<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10912" class="sup">4</span>Therefore Hanun took David's servants, shaved them, cut off their garments in the middle near their buttocks, and sent them away.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10913" class="sup">5</span>When David was told how the men were served, he sent to meet them, for [they] were greatly shamed and embarrassed. The king said, Stay in Jericho until your beards are grown, and then return.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10914" class="sup">6</span>When the Ammonites saw that they had made themselves hateful to David, Hanun and [his people] sent 1,000 talents of silver to hire chariots and horsemen from Mesopotamia and Aram-maacah and Zobah.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10915" class="sup">7</span>So they hired 32,000 chariots, and the king of Maacah and his troops, who came and pitched before Medeba. And the Ammonites gathered from their cities and came to battle.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10916" class="sup">8</span>When David heard of it, he sent Joab and all the army of mighty men.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10917" class="sup">9</span>And the Ammonites came out and lined up in battle array before the entrance of the city [Medeba], and the kings who had come were by themselves in the open country.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10918" class="sup">10</span>When Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose from all the choice men of Israel and put them in array against the Syrians.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10919" class="sup">11</span>The rest of the soldiers he delivered to Abishai his brother, and they were arrayed against the Ammonites.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10920" class="sup">12</span>And he said, If the Syrians are too strong for me, then you help me; but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, I will help you.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10921" class="sup">13</span>Be of good courage and let us behave ourselves courageously for our people and for the cities of our God; and may the Lord do what is good in His sight.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10922" class="sup">14</span>So Joab and the people who were with him drew near before the Syrians for battle, and they fled before him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10923" class="sup">15</span>And when the Ammonites saw that the Syrians fled, they likewise fled before Abishai, Joab's brother, and entered into the city [Medeba]. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10924" class="sup">16</span>When the Syrians saw that they were defeated by Israel, they sent messengers and drew forth the Syrians who were beyond the Euphrates River, with Shophach the commander of the army of Hadadezer at their head.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10925" class="sup">17</span>It was told to David, and he gathered all Israel and crossed the Jordan and drew up his army against them. So when David set the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10926" class="sup">18</span>But the Syrians fled before Israel, and David slew of the Syrians 7,000 men in chariots and 40,000 foot soldiers, and killed Shophach the commander of the army.<p />  <span id="en-AMP-10927" class="sup">19</span>When the servants of Hadadezer saw that they were defeated before Israel, they made peace with David and became subject to him; nor would the Syrians any longer help the Ammonites.<p /> </p><p /><br /></div>
